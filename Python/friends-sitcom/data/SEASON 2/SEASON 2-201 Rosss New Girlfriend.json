Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?\nOpening Credits\n"

Everything. (Looks at Julie)\nRoss: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.\nRachel: These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly, thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.\nJulie: (Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.\nRachel: Ok, well, not a problem.

Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.\nMonica: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?\nJulie: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.\nRoss: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.\nRachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?\nMonica: (to Julie) It's an expression.\nRoss: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.\nJulie: And then we've gotta get some sleep.\nRoss: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.\nChandler: Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.\n(Ross and Julie exit)\nRachel: Bye.

I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.\nRoss: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?\nChandler: God?\nRoss: It was you, pal.\nChandler: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.\nRoss: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all.
