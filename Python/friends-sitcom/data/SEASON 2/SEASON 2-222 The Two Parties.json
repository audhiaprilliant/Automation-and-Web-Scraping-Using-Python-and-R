Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?\nMONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?\nROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?\nJOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?\nROSS: Yeah.\nPHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.\nMONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.\n[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts]\nMONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake.

Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.\nPHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.\nJOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.\n[Rachel enters]\nROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?\nRACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.\nCHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.\nRACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.\nMONICA: So what happened?\nRACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.\nPHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.\nMONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?\nCHANDLER: Why her mom?\nMONICA: Cause I already invited her.\nPHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?\nJOEY: Oh no, can't invite her.

So bye-bye.\nMR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.\nMONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.\nMR.

Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?\nCHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.\nMRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you.

[Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]\nPHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]\nMONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.\nCHANDLER: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?\nJOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.\nMONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.\nCHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?\nMONICA: Because that's where the party is you goon.

GREENE: I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.\nROSS: No. no.\nMR. GREENE: Whad'ya mean no?\nROSS: No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area.

GREENE: Get my glasses too.\nROSS: All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time.

Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.\nRACHEL: This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?\nCHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.\nRACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.\nCHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?\nRACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...\nCHANDLER: I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]\n"
