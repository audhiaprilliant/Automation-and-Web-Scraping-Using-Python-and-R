A month?\nMonica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That\u2019s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top.
