Hello!\nPhoebe: (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y\u2019know? And I got nauseous.\nChandler: Maybe that\u2019s because soy-burgers suck!\nPhoebe: Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.\nJoey: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.\nPhoebe: That\u2019s sweat.

Look, he said he\u2019s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!

(Points to the living room.)\nRachel: Uhh, because I\u2019m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he\u2019s looking over here, say something funny.\nChandler: Like what?\n(Rachel laughs hysterically.)\nJoey: What-what-what is so funny?\nChandler: I said, \"Like what?\"\nJoey: Now that\u2019s a thinker.\nRachel: Okay, y\u2019know what, y\u2019know what?

(Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)\nRoss: (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.\nEmily: Oh, but the party\u2019s only just getting started!\nRoss: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y\u2019know, then The Plaza for dinner.\nEmily: So why did you plan a party at the same time?\nRoss: No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It\u2019s usually, \"Surprise!\" And then, \"Oh my God, I\u2019m so surprised\u2014good-bye!\"\nEmily: But Ross, I\u2019m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.\nRoss: Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica\u2019s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)\n[Cut to Joey and Phoebe in the kitchen. Phoebe is watching Joey make a sandwich.]\nPhoebe: Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?\nJoey: A little salami.\nPhoebe: Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?\nJoey: Pastrami.\nPhoebe: Oooh, yeah. You\u2019re a genius.\n(Rachel enters, she has changed clothes.)\nRachel: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?\nJoey: Yeah. (He goes over to her.)\nRachel: Up!\nMonica: You changed?\nRachel: Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.\nMonica: And lucky means, more cleavage?\nChandler: Does for me.\n(Joey starts wiping lint off of her back, but goes at little too far and Rachel just glares at him. He stops, gives her the \u2018okay\u2019 symbol and walks away.)\nRachel: Ohh, God! Look at him, he\u2019s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?\nJoey: Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.\nRachel: What?\nJoey: There was a seen in Footloose...\nChandler: Flashdance.\nJoey: Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl\u2026\nChandler: She was a welder.\nJoey: What? Were you like in the movie, or\u2026 Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.\nMonica: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.\nRachel: It\u2019s not Christmas!\nMonica: Or Spin the Bottle?\nRachel: He\u2019s not 11!\nEmily: (with her coat on, she\u2019s leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.\nRachel: What? You\u2019re leaving?!\nRoss: Yes, we have something we have to get to.\nJoshua: Uhh, yeah, I think I\u2019m going to take-off too.\nRachel: No! You guys can\u2019t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!\nRoss: What big thing?\n[Cut to later, the whole group is seated on the floor and Rachel is explaining the rules of Spin the Bottle.]\nRachel: (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther\u2019s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?\nEmily: I\u2019ll go.\nAll: Yay!\n(Emily spins the bottle and it lands on Joey.)\nJoey: Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)\n(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)\nMonica: Two in a row! You\u2019ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)\nRachel: Yay! Emily!\n(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)\nChandler: What are the odds? What are the odds?\n(They both move to kiss again.)\nRoss: (stopping them) Okay, that-that\u2019s enough! Y\u2019know, let\u2019s, let\u2019s let someone else play.\nJoey: If you didn\u2019t want to play, why did you come to the party?\nRachel: Okay, my turn!!\n(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands on\u2026.wait for it\u2026.Joshua. (You thought I was going to say Ross, didn\u2019t you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)\nPhoebe: Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!\nAll: Ohh!\nRachel: It\u2019s okay! It\u2019s okay! It kicked once, it\u2019ll kick again!\nAll: Oh my God!\n(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from kissing Joshua.)\nRachel: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.\n(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down, Rachel pretends she\u2019s knocking a bug off his leg.)\nRachel: Just a bug.\nCommercial Break\n"

No extra animals would die, you-you\u2019d just be eating my animals.\nPhoebe: Joey, I can\u2019t believe you would do that for me.\nJoey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian.

I\u2019m just losing a tooth, it\u2019s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y\u2019know. I\u2019m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?\nMonica: I think you\u2019re done.\nJoey: Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)\nJoshua: Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.\nJoey: (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.\nRachel: All right, come on, let\u2019s go get your coat.\nJoshua: Okay.\n(They both go to Chandler\u2019s bedroom to get his coat.)\n[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]\nGunther: Rachel is my girlfriend.\n[Cut to Chandler\u2019s bedroom.]\nJoshua: So, this was uh, really fun.\nRachel: Oh, yeah!

No, I got this all under control.\nJoshua: You really don\u2019t seem like you do. That\u2019s\u2026\n(She is still yanking on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve.
