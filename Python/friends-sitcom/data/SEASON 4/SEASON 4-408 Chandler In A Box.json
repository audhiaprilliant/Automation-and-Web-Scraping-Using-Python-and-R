Aww!\nPhoebe: Look everyone, it\u2019s the spirit of Thanksgiving!\nRachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?\nChandler: They couldn\u2019t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.\nRachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?\nRoss: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?\nRachel: You shouldn\u2019t.\nPhoebe: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there\u2019s the added mystery of who gets who.\nRoss: Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don\u2019t know why I do that.\n[Cut to later, the gang, minus Joey, is watching the Thanksgiving Day parade.]\nRachel: Well, I\u2019m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.\nMonica: We haven\u2019t eaten yet!\nRachel: I know, but all that work you\u2019re doing to get it ready, I just\u2026 (goes into her bedroom.)\nChandler: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, \u2018cause I wanna trade for her.\nPhoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!\nChandler: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?\nPhoebe: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it\u2019s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let\u2019s trade!\nChandler: Oh that\u2019s not true! That\u2019s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it\u2026 (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe\u2019s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it\u2026 (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials\u2026\nPhoebe: Ohh.\nMonica: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.\nChandler: Op, y'know what though, it\u2019s kind\u2019ve a girlie briefcase.\nMonica: Who cares? He works in a museum!\nChandler: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!\nPhoebe: You don\u2019t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren\u2019t here, you can watch the parade if you want.\nChandler: Thanks.\nMonica: What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!\nPhoebe: God, what happened?!\nMonica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!\nRachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!\nChandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.\nPhoebe: Open it up, let me see.\nMonica: Oh, y\u2019know what, I can\u2019t, it really kills.\nChandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.\nPhoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad.\nRachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.\nMonica: No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can\u2019t go to him when I don\u2019t have a boyfriend!\nChandler: He\u2019s really picky about his patients.\nPhoebe: Honey, you\u2019ve got to go. What\u2019s his office number?\nMonica: Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.\nPhoebe: (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I\u2019m calling on behalf of Monica Geller\u2019s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He\u2019s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?\nMonica: Yes!!\nPhoebe: Yes! She\u2019s very excited about that.\n[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]\nPhoebe: This is so cool, \u2018til Monica gets back, it\u2019s like I\u2019m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)\nRoss: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!\nPhoebe: Okay, get out of my kitchen!\nChandler: (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.\nPhoebe: All right I\u2026 I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.\nRoss: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I\u2019m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.\nChandler: Oh y\u2019know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.\nRoss: Really?! Wow! That\u2019s-that\u2019s so nice, what are you gonna get me?\nChandler: I don\u2019t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.\nRoss: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.\nChandler: Oh no-no-no, you don\u2019t want to do that, then you\u2019re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.\nRoss: Oh, that\u2019s not true! I\u2019ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.\nChandler: Like?\nRoss: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.\nChandler: When was the last time you saw her wear it?\nRoss: Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh\u2026\nChandler: Big dog?\n"

(goes to her room)\nRachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?\nJoey: Chandler?\nChandler: The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!\nRoss: (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year?

I wear it all the time.\nRoss: (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.\nRachel: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.\nRoss: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!\nRachel: Well isn\u2019t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?\nRoss: What did you get?\nRachel: Credit.\n(There\u2019s a knock on the door.)\nMonica: (running in from her bedroom) I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it! I\u2019ll get it!

What happened?!\nJoey: You kissed my girlfriend!\n(A commercial for sunglasses comes on.)\nRachel: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.\nRoss: Like \u2018em, like \u2018em? Or, I\u2019d like to get store credit for that amount like \u2018em?\nRachel: (Swears in Italian, it\u2019s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)\nMonica: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!\nTim: Where can I wash up?\nMonica: Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.\nTim: Thank you.\nRachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin\u2019 that for the Pope!\nMonica: See he\u2019s nice. Right?\nPhoebe: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, \"That\u2019s not how your dad used to do it.\"\nTim: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?\nMonica: I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)\nRachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.\n(There\u2019s a loud knocking.)\nPhoebe: Oh, I\u2019ll get it. (goes over to the door.)\nChandler: Gotcha! (laughs)\nJoey: That doesn\u2019t sound like thinking to me!\nChandler: Sorry!\nJoey: Y\u2019know I don\u2019t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you\u2019ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!\nChandler: Okay, okay, you got it!\nRachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?\nRoss: Sure! Oh, and Joey\u2019s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.\nRachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!\nMonica: Oh-ho-ho, we\u2019ve got company.\nRoss: There\u2019s nothing the matter with me. See, I\u2019m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.\nRachel: Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)\n(an awkward silence follows)\nChandler: You can\u2019t tell, but I\u2019m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!\nJoey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you\u2019re just an idiot in a box!\nChandler: You\u2019re right, and I\u2019m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won\u2019t say another word tonight.\nJoey: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?\nChandler: Absolutely!\nJoey: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There\u2019s no response from Chandler.) Okay.\n(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)\nRachel: Don\u2019t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what\u2019s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we\u2026 were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!\nRoss: I don\u2019t know what to say, I\u2019m sorry. Though, you\u2019re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It\u2019s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.\n(Rachel glares at him.)\n[Cut to the balcony with Monica and Tim.]\nMonica: (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)\nTim: Here, let me help. (Does so.)\nMonica: Thank you.\nTim: You-you have a very beautiful\u2026 eye.\nMonica: Y\u2019know all my friends think this is weird.\nTim: Y\u2019know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn\u2019t.\nMonica: I know! I mean it\u2019s like me and your dad, that\u2019s a totally separate thing.\nTim: Oh, I totally agree.\nMonica: We\u2019re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?\n(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica pulls away.)\nTim: What?\nMonica: Nothing. Nothing.\nTim: No-no really, was-was that not okay?\nMonica: No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss\u2026\nTim: Oh my God! It didn\u2019t remind you of\u2026\nMonica: (interrupting) Don\u2019t say it!\nTim: No, but it did! Didn\u2019t it?!\nMonica: Yeah!\nTim: Oh man!!\nMonica: I know!\n(They both shiver in horror.)\n[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. There\u2019s a knock on the door.]\nJoey: I\u2019ll get it. (It\u2019s Kathy.)\nKathy: (sees it\u2019s Joey) Oh.\nJoey: Hey.\nKathy: Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am\u2026\nJoey: That\u2019s okay. Chandler\u2019s the one I\u2019m mad at.\nKathy: Well, I\u2019m still sorry. Is he here?\nJoey: In the box.\nKathy: (going over to the box) Chandler?\nPhoebe: Oh, he-he can\u2019t talk right now.\nKathy: Why not? What\u2019s going on?\nPhoebe: He\u2019s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.\nKathy: By being in a box?\nRachel: Joey, had reasons.\nPhoebe: They were threefold.\nKathy: Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm\u2026 (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint and leave them alone.) Listen I don\u2019t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can\u2019t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don\u2019t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don\u2019t think we can see each other anymore. I\u2019m gonna go to my mom\u2019s in Chicago, I\u2019m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could\u2019ve be something really amazing, but y\u2019know this is probably for the best. Y\u2019know? I\u2019m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.\n(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves good-bye with one finger extended through the air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)\nJoey: (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)\nRachel: What?!\nJoey: He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!\nChandler: So?\nJoey: Yeah, we\u2019re gonna be fine! Get out!\nChandler: Yeah?\nJoey: Yeah, you did some real good thinkin\u2019 in there.\nChandler: Man, this is\u2026\n(Joey says something unintelligible and they hug.)\nJoey: Now go! \u2018Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you\u2019re secret Santa!
