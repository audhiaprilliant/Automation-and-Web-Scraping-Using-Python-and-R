            "dialog": "Joey: If anything should happen to him\u2026\nRoss: Joey! The vet said it\u2019s a simple procedure.\nJoey: So! Things can go wrong! You don\u2019t know! What if he doesn\u2019t make it?!\nChandler: He will, Joe.\nJoey: Yeah, but what if he doesn\u2019t? He\u2019s such a good duck.\n(With that we go into a little flashback about the guys\u2019 memories of the duck. The first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then it\u2019s Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then it\u2019s Chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girls\u2019 apartment, Joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them, and it\u2019s concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping it\u2019s wings. And the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)\nJoey: I\u2019m so worried about him, y\u2019know?\nThe Doctor: (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?\nRoss: Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it\u2019s been.)\nJoey: H-h-h-how\u2019s the duck?\nThe Doctor: He\u2019s doing just fine, he\u2019s resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.\nJoey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.\nRoss: No, that\u2019s all right.\nJoey: No, it\u2019s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!\nChandler: Hey, come on, it\u2019s not your fault.\nJoey: Yeah, it is! You wouldn\u2019t have lost the ring, right? Y\u2019know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.\nChandler: No, you should.\nJoey: Now, don\u2019t argue with me\u2026\nRoss: Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.\nChandler: Really?\nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my\u2026 I mean, I\u2019m lucky to have just one good\u2026 (They all start getting emotional.)\nChandler: Thanks man.\nJoey: (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they can\u2019t see him cry.)\nChandler: What a baby.\nRoss: Total wuss!\n(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)\nClosing Credits\n[There was no closing scene, only a preview of the wedding.]\nEnd\n"
