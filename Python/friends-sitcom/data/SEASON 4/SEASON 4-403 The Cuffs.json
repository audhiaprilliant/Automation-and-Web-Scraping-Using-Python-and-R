And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.\nRachel: What?!\nJoey: Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.\nMonica: Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?\nJoey: Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?\nMonica: Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)\nAll: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\nPhoebe: Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.\nRoss: With such a sad history.\nChandler: Could there be more Kims?\n(They all laugh and Joey joins them, not to be left out.
