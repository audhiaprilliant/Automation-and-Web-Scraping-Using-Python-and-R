(Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?\nRachel: Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?\nRoss: Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.\nChandler: Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.\nRoss: I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time.

It's an early edition of her favorite book.\nRachel: Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!\nChandler: Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.\nRachel: Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?\nChandler: Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.\nRachel: Oh, honey, that's so sweet.\nPhoebe: Yeah, and what a great way to say, \"I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!\"\nChandler: It doesn't say that. Does it?\nRoss: How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?\nChandler: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.\nPhoebe: It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!\nMonica: (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.\nRachel: Oh my God! What happened?\nMonica: Sixty guests.\nRoss: So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?\nMonica: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.\nPhoebe: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?\nMonica: I don't know.\nPhoebe: There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!\nMonica: Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.\nPhoebe: Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.\nMonica: Well, you're not working either.\nPhoebe: Yes, but I'm doing this.\nMonica: Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!\n[Joey enters]\nJoey: Hey!\nEveryone: Hey.\nKathy: Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?\nJoey: Why?\n[Kathy whispers something in Joey's ear]\nJoey: You can pee here!\nKathy: Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.\nChandler: It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?\nJoey: We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?\nEveryone: Yeah!\nRachel: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.\nJoey: Oh, I know...\nRachel: And not one of your coupons for an hour of \"Joey Love.\"\n[cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment.

I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.\nPhoebe: Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.\n[Monica enters]\nMonica: Hey!\nRachel: Hey, how'd it go?\nMonica: Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow\u2014the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!\nPhoebe: Mon! I'm so happy for you!\nMonica: Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!\nPhoebe: I'll have one, please. Plus my money.\nMonica: Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look\u2014I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.\nPhoebe: Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.\nMonica: Okay.\n"
