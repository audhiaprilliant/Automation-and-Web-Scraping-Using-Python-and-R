How did you meet her?\nPhoebe: Oh, which museum?\nPhoebe: (just Phoebe) No, answer his.\nRoss: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she\u2019d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.\nChandler: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?\nRoss: No, I\u2019m getting back down \u2018cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she\u2019s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.\nChandler: How can she be great if she\u2019s from Poughkeepsie?

I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can\u2019t believe I missed it.\nRachel: Hey, y\u2019know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it\u2019ll be Valentine\u2019s Day, then my birthday, then bang!\u2014before you know it, they\u2019re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!

I didn\u2019t think girls ever just wanted a fling.\nRachel: Well, believe me, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been flung.\nJoey: Well, I know what I\u2019m giving you for Christmas.\nChandler: Y\u2019know what? There\u2019s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?\nRachel: Yeah! Wait a minute, it\u2019s been a long time that I\u2019ve been single. How come you never offered this before?\nChandler: Well, I have a girlfriend, I\u2019m-I\u2019m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.\nRachel: Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don\u2019t like guys with boring jobs.\nChandler: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?\n(Monica enters)\nAll: Hey!\nPhoebe: What\u2019s wrong Mon?\nMonica: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.\nPhoebe: Oh.\nMonica: I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef\u2019s hat. (The hat says \u2018Quit, bitch\u2019)\nPhoebe: Hey, maybe they meant to write, \u2018Quiet, bitch.\u2019\nRachel: Hey, honey! What\u2019s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!\nMonica: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)\nJoey: Ohhh!\nMonica: I mean they\u2019re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life.\nRachel: Well, wait a minute, you\u2019re the boss! Why don\u2019t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?\nMonica: I would love too, but I can\u2019t! I mean I just can\u2019t, you know that I\u2019m not good at confrontation.\nChandler: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who\u2019s boss.\nJoey: Hey, Mon! I\u2019m not doing anything, why don\u2019t you fire me?\nMonica: That\u2019s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?\nJoey: Good enough to get fired.\nMonica: All right, you\u2019re hired!\nJoey: Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?\nChandler: (he glares at him for a while) Yes.\n"
