Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they\u2019re gonna go to their cast parties and he\u2019s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it\u2019ll be like, \"So where\u2019s your boyfriend, what\u2019s-his-name, Chester?\" And she\u2019ll go, \"No-no-no, it\u2019s Chandler.\" And he\u2019ll go, \"Whatever.

They\u2019re there to do a job, just \u2018cause they work together, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gonna get together. I mean just \u2018cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna happen with them.\nRoss: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.\nJoey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.\nRoss: Yeah.\nPhoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.\nRoss: They\u2019re not a couple!\nPhoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now.\nJoey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?\nRoss: Oh yeah!\nJoey: Well okay, so then you\u2019re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it\u2019s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It\u2019s when the heat goes away, that\u2019s when you\u2019re in trouble.\nChandler: Really?\nJoey: Look, you guys have been to every play I\u2019ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?\nRoss: No.\nJoey: Noooo!!\n"

I\u2019m always the hostess.\n(Chandler returns.)\nRoss: Hey!\nJoey: How\u2019d it go?\nChandler: Well, she wasn\u2019t sleeping with him.\nPhoebe: Oh good!\nChandler: She is now.\nRoss: What are you saying?\nChandler: I\u2019m saying that she\u2026 is a devil woman! Y\u2019know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don\u2019t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.\nPhoebe: How? How is your fault?\nChandler: Because, I-I should\u2019ve called! Y\u2019know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would\u2019ve gone out with Nick, and they would\u2019ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!\nRachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.\nRoss: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break\u2026\n(They all turn and glare at him.)\nClosing Credits\n"
