I mean it\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m in love with my roommates girlfriend\u2014which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we\u2019re in the room together there\u2019s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I\u2019ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she\u2019s smooth! Smooth!

And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)\nChandler: Wait! You\u2019re going out with Kathy!\nJoey: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?\nChandler: Well, I\u2019m upset\u2014for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can\u2019t believe he just sad that.)\nJoey: What is the big deal? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re exclusive.\nChandler: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she\u2019s-she\u2019s smart, and funny, and gets you.\nJoey: You got all that from the back of her head?\nChandler: All right look, I think it\u2019s time for you to settle down.

Play!\n(Ross starts to play. He plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. Over the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam, someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes, and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. Basically, the music sucks.)\nMonica: (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm\u2026 terrific.\nChandler: Really, bitchin\u2019!\nPhoebe: Wow, it was so\u2014wow!\nRoss: Really?! I mean, really?!!\nRachel: Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!\nRoss: Wow! Thanks, you guys. That\u2019s uh\u2014ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh!
