See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.\nRachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.\nAmy: You can?\nRachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.\nAmy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.\nRachel: Did you just say Emma?\nAmy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.\n"

Mike, obviously you have balls.\nMike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.\nPhoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.\n(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)\nPhoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?\nMike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)\nPhoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\nMike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\n(Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face)\nMike: I'm gonna do this now.\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\n(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)\nMike: Phoebe, I...\nPhoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)\nMike: Ready?\nPhoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)\nMike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?\nPhoebe: Yes!\n(Mike puts the ring on her finger)\nMike: I love you!\nPhoebe: I love you more!\nMike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.\n(They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.)\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n \n"
