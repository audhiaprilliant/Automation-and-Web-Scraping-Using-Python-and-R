You got us a chick and a duck?\nMonica: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.\nJoey: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!\nChandler: Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.\nMonica: Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.\nChandler: Alright.\n(Monica turns around and is about to leave when she steps on something.)\nMonica: Oh God! What did I just step on?\nJoey: Oh!\nChandler: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.\nMonica: Oh..\nJoey: You stepped on my egg roll?\nMonica: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.\nJoey: Just put it on a plate and leave.\n(She does so.)\nChandler: Okay, let's find these birds.\nJoey: Alright.\n(Suddenly, they hear the birds.)\nJoey: Wait, wait. Do you hear that?\n(They realise that the birds are in the foosball table.)\nJoey: Oh! They're in the table!\nChandler: Well, that can't be good!\nJoey: We gotta get them out of there!\nChandler: How?\nJoey: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?\nChandler: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.\nJoey: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.\nChandler: Joey, wait! The ball!\nJoey: Oh!\n(The ball rolls into one of the goals, and Chandler and Joey listen in horror as the ball makes its way inside the table. Finally, they can hear the birds again.)\nJoey: Oh God! So what do we do?\nChandler: I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.\nJoey: Okay.\nChandler: No... It's all glued together.\nJoey: Does that mean we have to bust it open?\nChandler: I don't know. Maybe.\nJoey: Oh my God!\nChandler: I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.\nJoey: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. \"Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine.\"\nChandler: Did that movie ever get made?\nJoey: It did not.\n \n"
