I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.\nChandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.\nPhoebe: (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either \"Liar, Liar\" or \"Betrayal\", or... \"An Affair To Remember\".\nChandler: Those are all really old!\nPhoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...\nRachel: (whispering) \"Dude, Where's My Car?\"\nPhoebe: (glancing at her) What?\nRachel: They're in a caaar...\nPhoebe: (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later.

Nancy is our realtor.\nJoey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!\nPhoebe: Why do you have a realtor?\nMonica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.\nJoey: (clearly shocked) What?\nRachel: Are you serious?\nMonica: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.\nPhoebe: So you're gonna move?\nRoss: Oh my God.\nJoey: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!\nRachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!\nMonica: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...\nChandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.\nRoss: (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?\nPhoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?\nRoss: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.\nJoey: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)\nRoss: (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.\n(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)\nChandler: Actually, we already found a house we love.\nRoss: What?\nMonica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.\n(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)\nChandler: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?\nTIME LAPSE\nRoss: You put an offer on a house?\nMonica: (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)\nPhoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?\nChandler: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.\nJoey: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!\nChandler: (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)\nMonica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?\nRachel: Yeah it is.\nJoey: What the hell are you doin'?\nRachel: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!\nPhoebe: Yeah, but so is this.\nRoss: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?\n \n[We fade to some flashback scenes.]\n(from 1.01 - \"The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate - The Pilot\")\nRachel: (talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\n \n(from 1.18 - \"The One With All the Poker\")\nRoss: That money is mine, Green!\nRachel: You're fly is open, Geller!\nPhoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?\nChandler: Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!\n \n(from 1.07 - \"The One With The Blackout\")\nPhoebe: [looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.\n[They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.]\nRachel: Ow, that had to hurt!\n \n(from 3.09 - \"The One With All the Football\")\nPhoebe: Hey, it\u2019s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.\nThe Guys: We will. (they don\u2019t move)\nMonica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.\nRachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.\n(Rachel sticks a marshmallow into Monica\u2019s nose. Monica takes it out of her nose by closing one nostril, and blowing.)\nMonica: Every year.\n \n(from 5.08 - \"The One With the Thanksgiving Flashbacks\")\nJoey: (he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!\nPhoebe: (walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?\nJoey: I put it on to scare Chandler!\nPhoebe: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!\nJoey: It smells really bad in here.\nPhoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!\n(They hear Monica trying to unlock the door. So Phoebe quickly pushes his head down onto the table to make it look like the turkey is just sitting on a platter and not stuck on Joey's head.)\nMonica: Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?\nJoey: It's Joey.\n \n(from 4.12 - \"The one With the Embryos\")\nMonica: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?\nRachel: Oooohh that\u2019s interesting.\nChandler: If you win, we give up the birds.\nJoey: (shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)\nChandler: But if we win, we get your apartment.\nJoey: Oooooh!\nMonica: Deal!\nTIME LAPSE\nRoss: What was Monica\u2019s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?\nJoey: Big fat goalie.\nRoss: Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie\u2026\nChandler: Dangerous Liaisons.\nRoss: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...\nJoey: Weekend at Bernie\u2019s.\nRoss: Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?\n(They both confer)\nJoey: Everyday use.\nChandler: Fancy.\nJoey: Guest.\nChandler: Fancy guest.\nRoss: Two seconds...\nJoey: Uhh, 11!\nRoss: 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)\nRoss: (to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl\u2019s breast?\nRachel: 14?\nRoss: No, 19.\nChandler: Thanks man.\nRoss: Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?\nMonica: Maurice.\nRoss: Correct, his profession was?\nRachel: Space cowboy!\nRoss: Correct! What is Chandler Bing\u2019s job?\n(The girls are stumped)\nRachel: Ow...Oh Gosh!\nRoss: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.\nMonica: It\u2019s umm, it has something to do with transponding.\nRachel: Oh-oh-oh, he\u2019s a transponce\u2014transpondster!\nMonica: That\u2019s not even a word!\n(Ross stops the clock, signifying the end of the lightning round.)\nMonica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\nTIME LAPSE\n(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)\nRachel: Y\u2019know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!\nJoey: Hey, don\u2019t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!\nRachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!\nMonica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn\u2019t gotten the question wrong!\nRachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!\nRoss: Don\u2019t blame the questions!\nChandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!\n \n(from 5.15 - \"The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey\")\nRoss: Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!\nChandler: (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)\nMonica: (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?\n(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)\nRoss: What the hell are doing?!!\nRachel: (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!\nChandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.\nJoey: (panicking) Dude! He's right there!\nRoss: (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!\nChandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.\nMonica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.\n(There's a brief pause.)\nRoss: (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)\n \n(from 6.06 - \"The One On The Last Night\")\nMonica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I\u2019m just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"\nRachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.\nPhoebe: Ok, you guys, I don\u2019t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don\u2019t want to live with Rachel anymore.\nMonica and Rachel: What?!\nPhoebe: You\u2019re just so mean to each other! And I don\u2019t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!\nRachel: Well, Phoebe that\u2019s fine because I\u2019m not moving.\nMonica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y\u2019know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y\u2019know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she\u2019ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I\u2019d like.\nPhoebe: What else?\nMonica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.\nRachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.\nPhoebe: That\u2019s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.\nMonica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.\nRachel: Well y\u2019know, I don\u2019t want you to be cold.\nMonica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)\nTIME LAPSE\n(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachel\u2019s old and now empty room.)\nChandler: (entering) Hey.\nMonica: She really left.\nChandler: I know. (He kisses her.)\nMonica: Thank you.\nChandler: No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)\nMonica: Can I ask you a question?\nChandler: Sure!\nMonica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)\n \n(from 1.09 - \"The One Where Underdog Gets Away\")\nChandler: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\nAll: That's so sweet.\nRoss: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\nChandler: Here, here!\n \n"
