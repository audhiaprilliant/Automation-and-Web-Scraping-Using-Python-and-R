I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...\nJoey: I am pretty wisdomous.\nPhoebe: So... what do you say?\nJoey: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.

(she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.\nPhoebe: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.\nMonica: You don't know military time?\nPhoebe: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.\nMonica: Just subtract twelve.\nPhoebe: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...\nMonica: (screaming) Six o'clock!\nPhoebe: Ok.\nMonica: Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?\nPhoebe: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.\nMonica: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.\nPhoebe: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.\nMonica: Ooh... she backed out.\nPhoebe: She did? Why?\nMonica: I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say \"elegant wedding\". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.\nPhoebe: (looking angry) Hey!

I was-I was going for a hand shake.\nMike: Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?\nRoss: That is why!\nMike: Yeah.\nPhoebe: So Rach.\nRachel: Yeah.\nPhoebe: Where is Emma?\nRachel: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.\nMonica: (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!

But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!\n(cut to Ross, Chandler and Rachel)\nChandler: (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.\nRoss: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?\nRachel: Uh... November?\nRoss: I wanna say it's not looking good.\nRachel: Hey Pheebs...\nPhoebe: What's up?\nRachel: Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.\nChandler: Heh.\nPhoebe: Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.\nRoss: What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)\nRachel: Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!\nPhoebe: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.\nRoss: Oh, man!\nChandler: This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!\nRoss: FOOTBALL!\nChandler: Thank you.\nMonica: (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.\nPhoebe: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!\nMonica: Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!\nPhoebe: I don't have a fax machine.\nMonica: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!\nRoss: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.\nChandler: I know, I hate being left out of things.\nRoss: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...\nMike: Hey guys, how is it going?\nChandler: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.\nMike: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.\nChandler: What happened?\nRoss: Who cares, AND?\nMike: ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up)\nRoss: I'll do it!\nChandler: (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!\nMike: You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.\nChandler: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.\nRoss: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?\nMike: You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)\nRoss: (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.\nChandler: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!\nRoss: Please, you're going down!\nChandler: You are going downer!\nRoss: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?\nChandler: (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!

No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?\nMike: No more so than acting.\nJoey: Strike two!\nMike: You're right.

Phoebe comes out of the ladies room and they run toward her.)\nRoss: So, what did you decide?\nPhoebe: I decided to pee.\nChandler: Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.\nPhoebe: Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!\nChandler: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.\nPhoebe: Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.\nRachel: (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!\nPhoebe: Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.\nRachel: What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.\nPhoebe: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.\nRoss: I'll do it! (Monica approaches)\nMonica: Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)\nMike: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?\nMonica: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!\nMike: Is that what you say to Chandler?\nMonica: (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)\nPhoebe: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...\nMonica (rolling her eyes): oh God.\nPhoebe: And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.\nMonica: What?\nPhoebe: YOU'RE FIRED!

I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.\nPhoebe: Oh, well that's ok.

Next are Rachel and Ross, who carries Chappy in his arms.)\nRachel: Geez Ross, you could have showered.\nRoss: It's the dog.\n(we cut to Monica)\nMonica: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.\n(She walks down the aisle with the groomsman. We cut to inside Central Perk, where Phoebe and Chandler are waiting.)\nChandler: Ready?\nPhoebe: (nervously) Okay.\nChandler: Okay.\nPhoebe: Oh wait, oh no. Wait.\n(She takes off the coat she was wearing over her wedding dress, which is violet and has a darker shade petticoat underneath which shows at one side where the dress is lifted up to about the height of her hip and connected to the petticoat. She's wearing a veil over her curly hair and a low cut top with straps only just hanging over her shoulders.)\nChandler: Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?\nPhoebe: I don't care... I'll be my something blue.\nChandler: You look beautiful.\nPhoebe: Thank you.\n(They start to leave Central Perk. The band starts to play \"Here, There and Everywhere\" by the Beatles. The crowd rises from their seats. Phoebe and Chandler walk down the aisle. Phoebe really glows with happiness. So does Mike who watches her walk down the isle. When Phoebe and Chandler arrive, they kiss and Phoebe walks to her bridesmaids.)\nMike: My God! Aren't you freezing?\nPhoebe: Na-ah.\n(the music ends)\nJoey: Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?\n(one of the groomsmen gives the rings to Joey)\nJoey: (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...\nPhoebe: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)\nMike: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)\nPhoebe: Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.\nMike: I love you too.\nRoss: Uh Joey...\nJoey: Yeah?\nRoss: Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.\nJoey: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?\nPhoebe: I do.\n(Joey has a \"Yeah you do\" smile on his face)\nJoey: Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?\nMike: I do.\nJoey: I now pronounce you... husband and wife.\n(Phoebe and Mike kiss)\nPhoebe: I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.\n(Mike takes off his coat to give to Phoebe and the steel band plays \"The Wedding Song\")\n \nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n"
