No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.\nMike: You're a strange kind of grown-up.\nPhoebe: Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do.

Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.\nJoey: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know.

So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said \"Wait a minute! Yes I am.\" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.\nMonica: Oh God. I'm so sorry.\n(Ross enters with a bottle in his hand)\nRoss: Hey! Wha-hoo!
