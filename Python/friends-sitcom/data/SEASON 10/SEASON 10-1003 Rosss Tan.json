I know exactly what I'm gonna do!\nChandler: Really? Like you have a routine?\nJoey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.\nChandler: Really?\nJoey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her.

I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!\nChandler: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.\nRoss: So, do you get colours or just French tips?\nMonica: There. Here's their card.\nRoss: Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist.

She's the worst!\nChandler: Who's Amanda?\nMonica: She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) \"Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!\"\nChandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?\nMonica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!\nChandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?\nPhoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?

All right, who hasn't?\nMonica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!\nPhoebe: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!\nMonica: What?\nPhoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!\nMonica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!

I said count to five'!\nRoss: Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how bad is it?\nAssistant: Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.\nRoss: So, how dark is it gonna get?\nAssistant: You got sprayed with two two' s and...\nRoss: I'm a four?\nAssistant: Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.\nRoss: (sarcastically) Really!\nAssistant: You might wanna get back in there.\nRoss: (annoyed) Ok!\n(The assistant leaves and Ross goes back in the spray-on tan booth and turns his back to the spray nozzles, facing the back wall)\nRoss: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah!
