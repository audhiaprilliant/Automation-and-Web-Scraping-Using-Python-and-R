This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.\nRachel: The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)\nFADE OUT\nRachel: Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.\nRoss: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?\nChandler: Or facing a bitch of a commute.\nRachel: I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.\nRoss: Okay.\nRachel: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.\nChandler: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)\nRoss: All right, we'll work it out.\nRachel: Thank you! Thank you!\nRoss: Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?\nRachel: I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)\nPhoebe: Ooh, what's going on?\nRachel: I got a really incredible job offer.\nJoey: Hey, great! All right!\nPhoebe: Good for you!\nRachel: It's in Paris.\nJoey: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married (to Phoebe) Congratulations! (pointing to Monica and Chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...\nMonica: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...\nJoey: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.\nRachel: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.\nPhoebe: Of course we can. Congratulations. (they hug, but Joey shakes his head.) Yay! (she gestures Joey to come and join in) Joey...\nJoey: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.\nRachel: (walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...\nJoey: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. (He walks out, and Rachel follows him)\nRachel: Joey...\nPhoebe: You okay with this?\nChandler: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...\nPhoebe: Talking to Ross.\nChandler: I see.\nRoss: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?\nMonica: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.\nRoss: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?\nMonica: How is that gonna happen?\nChandler: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?\nRoss: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.\nMonica: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?\nRoss: I didn't say we were brothers.\nOPENING CREDITS\n"

Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?\nChandler: Yeah.\nPhoebe: She died.\nChandler: You're kidding!\nMonica: That's terrible!\nPhoebe: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.

He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.\nMonica: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?\nPhoebe: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.\nMonica: What if he reads it in the paper?\nChandler: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.\n"

Isn't that true?\nMr Zelner: She is good!\nRoss: (surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.\nMr Zelner: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.\nRoss: I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?\nMr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?\nRoss: Oh, nothing, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?\nMr Zelner: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?\nRoss: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that\u2019s not good. Let me start again. I\u2019m a paleontologist, you\u2019ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones\u2026 fossils!\nMr Zelner: You can really arrange that?\nRoss: You let Rachel come back, and it\u2019s done.\nMr Zelner: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world.\nRoss: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.\nMr Zelner: That\u2019s great. I worry about little Ross. He\u2019s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he\u2019s obsessed with dinosaurs.\nRoss: He\u2019ll be fine.\n"
