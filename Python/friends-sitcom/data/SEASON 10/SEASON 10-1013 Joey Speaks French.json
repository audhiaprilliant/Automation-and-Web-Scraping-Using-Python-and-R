You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.\nRachel: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!\nRoss: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!\nRachel: Wow.

We have to find out which one the father is.\nMonica: How?\nChandler: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?\nMonica: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.\nChandler: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer.
