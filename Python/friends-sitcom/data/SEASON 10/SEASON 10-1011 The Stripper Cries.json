I'm good at it.\nChandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.\nRoss: You got it.\nChandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.\nRoss: Those are the pacts!\nChandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton.

When was this?\nRoss: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.\nMonica: Oh my God! That's wild!\nChandler: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.\nRoss: Well, it matters to me.\nChandler: Why?\nRoss: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.\nChandler: You kissed her that night too?\nMonica: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.\nChandler: Seriously, where did this happen?\nRoss: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.\nChandler: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?\nRoss: Mine.\nChandler: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.\nRoss: No, she was definitely on my bed.\nChandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?\nRoss: Well, then who was on my bed?\nMonica: (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)\nRoss: (realizing) NO! No, no!\nMonica: YES! (Chandler gets an \"oh no!\" look on his face)\nRoss: You were under the pile of coats?\nMonica: I was the pile of coats!\nRoss: OH MY GOD!\nMonica: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?\nRoss: You were my first kiss with Rachel?\nMonica: You were my first kiss ever?\nChandler: What did I marry into?\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n \n"
