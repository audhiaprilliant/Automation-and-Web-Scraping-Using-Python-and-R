Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.\nRoss: (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!\nChandler: No, no! We made this decision together.\nRoss: She's putting words in your mouth!\nJoey: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!\nRachel: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!\nMonica: No, it's not!\nRachel: It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?\nPhoebe: Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.\nMonica: Thank you, Pheebs!\nPhoebe: Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.\nMonica: What? You are way off, lady!\nPhoebe: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.\nMonica: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!\nChandler: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!\nMonica: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler!

I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.\nRachel: Did you at least win the contest?\nMonica: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin!

I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?\nPhoebe: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.\nRachel: Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!\nPhoebe: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!\nRachel: Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!\nPhoebe: (sarcastic) Oh... okay.\nRachel: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...\nRachel: And a thousand dollars.\nRachel: ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...\nPhoebe: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.\nRachel: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?\nPhoebe: Well, I was thinking...\nRachel: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.\nPhoebe: Yeah!\n \n"

It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.

Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.\nChandler: Tell me more.\nMonica: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall.

Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.\nJoey: Dude, two times that happened!\nChandler: Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!\nRoss: He's right, man.\nJoey: Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.\nChandler: Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!\nJoey: That's some gentle comedy, dude.

(Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.\nRoss: (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.\nRachel: You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall.

Let's just all go in at the same time.\nAll: Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)\nPhoebe: It's locked.\nRoss: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: \"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy\".\nRachel: Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\nMonica: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.\nChandler: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?\nMonica: (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.\nChandler: (relieved) Oh thank God!\n[cut to the hall]\nRoss: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.\nChandler: (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.\nRoss: (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)\nRachel: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)\nJoey: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\nMonica: That's all the turkey you're gonna get.\n[cut to the hall]\nRoss: How are we gonna decide who gets this?\nJoey: (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)\nPhoebe: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.\nRachel: (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah!\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\nMonica: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.\nChandler: Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)\n[cut to the hall]\n(Rachel comes out of the apartment holding a pot. Joey holds in anticipation and Rachel opens it)\nRachel: Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)\nRoss: That's worse than no food.\n[cut to Monica and Chandler]\n(Monica looks insulted)\nChandler: HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!\nMonica: Stinky?!\nChandler: Please let me stay on this side of the door.\n[cut to hall]\nRachel: Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.\nPhoebe: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.\nRachel: You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)\nJoey: (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.\nRoss: I don't know...\nJoey: I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.\nRoss: (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!\n(Rachel finally manages to open the door, but the door chain is on.)\nRachel: Oh!\n(Joey sticks his head through the gap. Monica and Chandler are now sitting at the dinner table. There is another smaller table full of food standing in front of the front door)\n(Monica and Chandler do not look amused by Joeys head in the door)\nJoey: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...\n(Monica is now smiling)\nChandler: The cranberries...?\nMonica: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!\nJoey: (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.\nChandler: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)\nJoey: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?\n(Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's and Phoebe's at the bottom)\nRoss: I feel terrible.\nPhoebe and Rachel: So, so sorry.\nJoey: (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?\nChandler: The floating heads do make a good point.\nMonica: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.\nRachel: So bad.\nRoss : So bad.\nPhoebe: So bad.\nMonica: (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.\nRachel: Dessert?\nMonica: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?\nPhoebe: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).\n(Monica takes it and reads the label)\nMonica: Grand Supreme Little Darling?\nRachel: Congratulatioooons!\nMonica: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.\nRoss: Really girls, not cool.\nChandler: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.\nJoey: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!\nRoss: It's a day to be thankful.\nJoey: (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!\nMonica: It's too late for apologies.\nJoey: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.\nChandler: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.\nRachel: Ewww, is that what that is?\nJoey: Sorry!\nPhoebe: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.\nRachel: Yeah! I'll cook!\nRoss: Yeah! Let's go out.\nRachel: Hey!\nJoey: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.\nMonica: The three of us?\nJoey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!\n(Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel and Ross pull back their heads)\nJoey: Ha!\n(When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices he is stuck)\nJoey: Oh-oh! I'm stuck!\nMonica: Joey, that is not gonna work.\nJoey: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.\nPhoebe: I'll pull you through.\nRoss: Okay.\nJoey: (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.\nChandler: A little late for that.\nJoey: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.\nMonica: Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.\nChandler: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.\nMonica: Bring it.\nJoey: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...\n(Chandler gives Monica a footlong \"eye dropper\" with the turkey grease in it)\nMonica: Here you go!\n(She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)\nJoey: Oh, that smells good!\n(And he starts licking the grease which trickles down his face. Monica also squirts some on the other side of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)\nJoey: Okay.\nMonica: Okay, try it.\n(Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)\nJoey: It isn't working.\nMonica: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.\nJoey: Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!\nChandler: Can you ever feel your ears?\nJoey: Interesting...\nMonica: Chandler, where are your tools?\nChandler: (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!\nMonica: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.\nRachel: I lent them to Ross.\nRoss: I gave them to Joey.\nJoey: I left them at the park.\nMonica: Oh!\nRoss: (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.\nPhoebe: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.\nRoss: Nice!\n(The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)\nMonica: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.\nJoey: It's really starting to hurt.\nChandler: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!\nPhoebe: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.\n(Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)\nJoey: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!\nChandler: Come on guys, PUSH!\nJoey: Yeah! Come on!\nJoey and Chandler: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!\n(The chain breaks loose from the wall, and because Joey was pushing with all his might, he propells into the kitchen, towards the table with all the food. This table has wheels underneath it, and when Joey falls on this table, he rides into the living room, with all the food falling off, until finally Joey also falls off... Joey gets up quickly, a bit agitated, and acting as nothing happened. He is covered in food stains.)\nChandler: My cranberries!\nJoey: (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.\n(He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler a taste.)\nChandler: Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!\n(Monica enters from the spare bedroom.)\nChandler: (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!\nMonica: (very emotional) I don't care.\n(Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)\nChandler: What's going on?\nMonica: That was the adoption agency...\nChandler: And?\nMonica: WE'RE GETTING A BABY!\nChandler: Are you serious? (they hug)\nMonica: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!\n(They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)\nRachel: I'm so happy for you!\nMonica: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!\n(They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the food off his shirt)\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\n"
