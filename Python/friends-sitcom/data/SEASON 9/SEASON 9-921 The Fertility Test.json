But SURPRISE!\nChandler: I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?\nRoss: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.\nRachel: I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!\nRoss: Why do you care so much?\nMonica: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?\nRachel: (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.\nRoss: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...\nPhoebe: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!\nRachel: All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...\nRoss: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...\n(Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her)\nRoss: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!\nJoey: Hey!\nAll: Hi!\nRoss: I'm gonna get some more coffee.\nCharlie: Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!\nRoss: Ok. (they both go)\nChandler: (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?\nJoey: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces \"amonious\"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?\nCharlie: (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.\nRoss: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.\nCharlie: You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...\nRoss: Yeah, I know the type.\nJoey: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?\nOpening credits\n"

It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.\nRachel: I don't care about any of that!!\nPhoebe: Well, do you care about friendship?\nRachel: Oh!\nPhoebe: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel.
