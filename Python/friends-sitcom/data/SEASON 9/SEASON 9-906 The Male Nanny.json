Monica clean.\nChandler: (clearly not so interested) Awesome.\nMonica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him.

(Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)\nPhoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.\nMike: Is it?\nPhoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?\nMike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a \"what's happening\" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...\nPhoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?\nMike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)\nPhoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.\nMike: It's to my apartment.\nPhoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.\nMike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...\nPhoebe: Oh no, I want to.\nMike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)\nPhoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)\nMike: Is this cool, huh?\nPhoebe: It really is.\nJoey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!

We're never gonna find a nanny.\nRoss: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.\nRachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?\nRoss: She was blonde?
