I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?\nChandler: I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.\nMonica: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.\nChandler: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.\nMonica: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.\nChandler: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?\nMonica: Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.\nChandler: No! We're not borrowing money.\nMonica: Why not?\nChandler: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.\nMonica: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.\nChandler: That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.\nOpening Credits\n"

I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.\nPhoebe: Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.\nMike: No, no!

So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.\nJoey: Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. \"Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\" or er.. \"Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!\nMonica: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?\nRachel: No. I was just going to do this myself.

You can't.\nRachel: Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?\nMonica: You're a pig. And you can't do this.\nRachel: Wha!? What!? Come on!
