I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.\nJoey: Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?\n(Ross enters.)\nRoss: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?\nRachel: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...\nJoey: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.\nRachel: Bye!\n(She leaves.)\nRoss: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.\nJoey: No, hey, it's been great.\nRoss: Yeah?\nJoey: Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...\nRoss: Yeah, that'll do it.\nJoey: Wow! So, how are you?\nRoss: I'm, I'm okay.\nJoey: Really?\nRoss: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.\nJoey: Well, actually it...\nRoss: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.\nJoey: Wow, really?\nRoss: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...\nJoey: Sure, I know lots of girls.\nRoss: Yeah? Any names come to mind?\nJoey: Ooh, names?\nOpening credits.\n"

Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.\nJoey: I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.\nPhoebe: Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.\nJoey: Why are they doing this?\nPhoebe: I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.\nJoey: You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?\nPhoebe: I just wish they'd realise they should be together.\nJoey: I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.\nPhoebe: I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.\nJoey: Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.\nPhoebe: You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.\nJoey: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.\nPhoebe: So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?\nJoey: I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.\nPhoebe: Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.\nJoey: Ooh, that's a great plan!\nPhoebe: Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my \"plan-laugh.\" (A maniacal laugh follows.)\n(They both start laughing really loudly.)\nJoey: Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...\n(He looks at his bedroom door, but he can't remember the name of the girl.)\n"

What's the big deal?\nMonica: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...\nRachel: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.\nChandler: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!\nMonica: You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!\nRachel: So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?\nMonica: Oh, it's perfect.\nRachel: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys.

What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!\nJoey: Oh my god, you're right!\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nJoey: She even reads for pleasure!\nPhoebe: How do you even know a woman like that?\nJoey: What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?\nPhoebe: Joey.\nJoey: I met her at the library. I went in to pee.\nPhoebe: So now what do we do?\nJoey: Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.\nPhoebe: What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!\nJoey: Ooh...I hear that's bad.\nPhoebe: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.\nJoey: Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)\nPhoebe: It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
