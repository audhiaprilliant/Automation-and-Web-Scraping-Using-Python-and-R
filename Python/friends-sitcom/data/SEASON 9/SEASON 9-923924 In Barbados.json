So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.\nJoey: All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.\nRoss: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!\nOpening credits\n"

(he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)\nMike: Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.\nDavid: Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.\nMike: Sorry David, but she really has to know this.\nDavid: Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.\nMonica: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...\nDavid: I have a ring.\nChandler: I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.\nDavid: Phoebe, will you marry me?\nPhoebe: (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!\nDavid: Uhm... Ha ha!\nPhoebe: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.\nMike: We can have any future you want.\n(they hold their hands, gazing at each other)\nDavid: Ok, I'm gonna take off.\nPhoebe: David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.\nDavid: Just so I know, if I had asked first...\nPhoebe: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.\nDavid: Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)\nMike: Is it ok if I hug you now?\nPhoebe: Yes! (they hug)\nMonica: (to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?\n"
