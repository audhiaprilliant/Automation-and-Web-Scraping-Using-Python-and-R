(realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!\nChandler: Do you have any ideas?\nJoey: Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...\nMonica: Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.\nJoey: (laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: \"Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird.\" (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)\nMonica: Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!\nJoey: Real estate, huh? Hmmm...\nMonica: (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!\nChandler: (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!\nMonica: My dad told me. They play golf together.\nChandler: Oh, well...

Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...\"\nMonica: You went out with Wallis Pincer?\nRachel: Uh, he took the SAT's for me.\nMonica: I knew you didn't get a 1400!\nRachel: Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...\nPhoebe: So... now... What about with Mike's mom?\nRachel: Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me.
