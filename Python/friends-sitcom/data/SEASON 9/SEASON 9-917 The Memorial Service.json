It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.\nChandler: Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .\nRoss: It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?\nChandler: The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?\nRoss: Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...\nChandler: Bet she'd sleep with you now...\nRoss: No... I already e-mailed her.\nChandler: Let me see what you wrote about yourself: \"Doctor Paleontology, two kids... \" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?...
