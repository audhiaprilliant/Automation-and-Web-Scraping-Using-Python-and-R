Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.\nMike: You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.\nPhoebe: What are those?\nMike: I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!\nPhoebe: OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.\nMike: Thank you.\nPhoebe: So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.

And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.\n(Heather walks in)\nHeather: Good morning!\nRachel: Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.\nGavin: What?\nRachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!\nGavin: I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.\nRachel: Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.\nGavin: Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?\nRachel: Oh yeah, I'm jealous. \"Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass\". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.\nGavin: I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.\nRachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.\nGavin: Huh. What's Tag's last name?\nRachel: It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.\nGavin: But it was a deap meaningful relationship.\nRachel: Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!\nGavin: It was Jones.\nRachel: Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?\n"

Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.\nChandler: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.\nMonica: Yeah.

(thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.\nRoss: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.\nJoey: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!\nRoss: What are you, a child?\nJoey: Yes!\nRoss: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.\nJoey: Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)\nMonica: (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)\n"

Because I could get a job any day now.\nRoss: You do appear right on the cusp of something.
