Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.\nChandler: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said\n\"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there.\" And I said \"Maybe if we put some light out there they will\"\nRoss: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,\neven though there were NO LIGHTS !\nChandler: So are you gonna...talk to her?\nRoss: Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!\nChandler: You know when \"That's fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!\nRoss: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know\nI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she\nbarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!\nChandler: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?\nRoss: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.\nAnd then the other day on the subway a woman \"accidentally\" sat on my hand.\nChandler: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!\nRoss: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental\nPotluck dinner.\nChandler: Why did I get married?!\n \n \n[Opening Credits]\n \n"

I kissed Gavin last night.\nPhoebe: Oh my god.\nMonica: You kissed him?\nRachel: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...\nMonica: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?\nPhoebe: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.\nMonica: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?\nRachel: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...\nMonica: I thought you hated him?\nRachel: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!\nMonica: So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?\nRachel: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't\nknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.\nMonica: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross\nRachel: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...\nPhoebe: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!\n \n"
