So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!\nRachel: Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!\nPhoebe: Exactly!\nRachel: And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!\nPhoebe: (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that!

So, keep having sex on a regular basis.\nChandler: Oh, DAMN IT!\n(Dr. Connelly glares at Chandler)\nMonica: Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.\nDoctor Connelly: Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.\nMonica: (long pause) Ok.\nDoctor Connelly: And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.\nChandler: Is that a hint?

How did it go at the fertility clinic?\nChandler: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.\nRoss: So-so what did the doctor say?\nChandler: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\nJoey: So you're ruling out surrogacy?\nChandler: Yeah.\nJoey: So, I don't have to learn what that means?\nChandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.\nJoey: Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?\nChandler: (stopping Joey) ah-ha!\nRoss: How do you feel about all this?\nChandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.\nJoey: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!\nRoss: (puzzled) What?\n(Joey moves close to Ross and whispers something in his ear)\nRoss: (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!\n"
