I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know!

I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).\n(silence)\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n"

Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't...
