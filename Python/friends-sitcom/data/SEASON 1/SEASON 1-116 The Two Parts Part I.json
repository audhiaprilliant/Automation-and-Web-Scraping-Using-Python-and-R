For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.\nChandler: Oh, well, ah... maybe that\u2019s because they\u2019re ah... jealous, of us.\nNina: Maybe. But that doesn\u2019t explain why they keep taking my scissors.\nChandler: Ah, well, maybe that\u2019s, ah, because you\u2019re getting a big raise.\nNina: I am?\nChandler: Sure, why not?\nNina: Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You\u2019re amazing!\nChandler: Oh, you don\u2019t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder\u2019s raise?\nHelen: (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?\nNina: What?\nChandler: Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?\n(Nina puts her hands on her hips, then gives Chandler a quizzical look.)\n"

Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?\nMonica and Rachel: (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.\nPhoebe: Well, but that\u2019s what he was for me.

Okay.\n(Monica and Ross indicate that they mean right now.)\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, oh.\n(Phoebe gets up and walks across the hallway, but the door to Chandler and Joey\u2019s apartment is shut.
