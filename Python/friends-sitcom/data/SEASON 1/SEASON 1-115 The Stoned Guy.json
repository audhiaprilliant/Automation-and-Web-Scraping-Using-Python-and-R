This was supposed to be a temp job!\nMonica: Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.\nChandler: If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.\nPhoebe: So was it a lot more money?\nChandler: It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.\n(Everyone looks at him, confused.)\nRachel: ... the WENUS?\nChandler: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems.

(pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.\nMonica: (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.\nPhoebe: Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....\nChandler: Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.\nPhoebe: (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!\nMonica: Well, what kind of food is he looking for?\nPhoebe: Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.\nMonica: (excited) Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know!

I love you, Ross.\nRoss: Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.\nRachel: So what are you guys going to do?\nRoss: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.\nChandler: And he's not speaking metaphorically.\nJoey: (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?\nRoss: Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.\nJoey: I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet!
