But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.\nRachel: Yeah right.\nRoss: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out.

I'm not in the zone.\nJoey: Ross, you're mayor of the zone.\nRoss: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...\nJoey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.\nRoss: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?\nJoey: Yeeeeaaaahhh!
