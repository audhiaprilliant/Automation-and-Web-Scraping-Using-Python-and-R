See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.\nTerry: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.\nRachel: Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.\n"

Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?\nRoss: No, they're not.\nMonica: Yes, they are.

As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.\nChandler: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.\nPhoebe: What were you modeling for?\nJoey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?\nMonica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"?\nPhoebe: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.\nChandler: Do you know which one you're gonna be?\nJoey: No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)\nChandler: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.\nJoey: Thanks.\n(Ross comes back to the couch.)\nRoss: (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.\nMonica: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.\nRoss: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?\nMonica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?\nJoey: Yeah.\nMonica: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.\nChandler: Yes, every single one of them.\nMonica: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?\nPhoebe: Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.\nMonica: So you're free Thursday, then.\nPhoebe: Yeah. Oh, can I come?\nMonica: Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?\nRachel: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.\nChandler: I thought it was $98.50.\nRachel: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.\nRoss: Well, I'm off to Carol's.\nPhoebe: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?\nRoss: (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.\n"

We can just look for it.\nRoss: Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.\nSusan: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.\nRoss: (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.\nSusan: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.\nRoss: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?\nSusan: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?\nRoss: You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?\nSusan: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.\nRoss: Do you uh, do you talk about me?\nSusan: Yeah, yeah, all the time.\nRoss: Really?\nSusan: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.\n"

In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.\n(Rachel enters.)\nMonica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?\nRachel: No, not even close.

Inside is the money she needed.)\nRachel: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.\nMonica: We all chipped in.\nJoey: (to Monica) We did?\nMonica: (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.\nRachel: Thank you. Thank you so much!\nMonica: (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.\nRachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?\nChandler: All right, I'm nine years old.\nRoss: Oh, I hate this story.\nChandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.\nRachel: Oh my god.\nChandler: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.\n"

I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\nAll: That's so sweet.\nRoss: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\nRachel: And a crappy New Year.\nChandler: Here, here!\n[Scene: The Subway, Joey sees his poster and he peels off the caption on his poster, revealing more posters underneath.
