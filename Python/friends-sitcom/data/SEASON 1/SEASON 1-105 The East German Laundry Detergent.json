Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?\nRachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.\nChandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.\nJoey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.\n(Long pause.)\nRoss: Multiple orgasms!\n"

You just gotta do it.\nChandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.\nJoey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.\nPhoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.\nChandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.\nPhoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.\nRoss: Tony?\nMonica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.\nRachel: (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?\nRoss: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.\nPhoebe: (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?\nRachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.\nRoss: That guy, he burns me up.\nRachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.\nChandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.\nMonica: Did he give you that whole \"You're-not-up-to-this\" thing again?\nRachel: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \"You'll never make it on your own\".\nPhoebe: (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.\n(Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.)\nAngela: Hi, Joey.\nJoey: My god, Angela.\n(Angela takes a seat at the counter.)\nMonica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.\nPhoebe: Are you gonna go over there?\nJoey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.\nAngela: (casually) Joey.\nJoey: You look good.\nAngela: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.\nJoey: You don't say.\n(Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.)\nRoss: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?\nRachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.\nRoss: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?\nRachel: Who?\nRoss: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?\nRachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?\nRoss: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?\nRachel: Sure.\n(Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.)\nAngela: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.\nJoey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?\nAngela: Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...\nJoey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.\nAngela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?\nJoey: What?\nAngela: We're just friends.\nJoey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?\nAngela: What four of us?\nJoey: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.\n"

Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.\nRoss: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.\nRachel: (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties.
