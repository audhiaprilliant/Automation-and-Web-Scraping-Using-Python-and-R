Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?\nMonica: I did.\nPhoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah.\nJoey: Not me.\nRoss: Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.\nChandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?\nRoss: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...\n(Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler's look and abruptly stops.)\nChandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?\nPhoebe: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...\nChandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?\nAll: Yeah! Right!\nChandler: WHAT IS IT?!\nMonica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.\nAll: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.\nChandler: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.\n(Phone rings; Monica gets it)\nMonica: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.\nRachel: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.\nRoss: (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.\nRachel: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.\nMonica: Hey dad, what's up?

We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.\nMonica: Oh God!\n(They hug.)\n[Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana.]\nMonica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.\nRoss: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los.

Monica runs out of the room.)\nMonica: Ross!\n(Ross runs out too.)\nMrs. Geller: What is going on?!\nRoss: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..\nMrs. Geller: What?\nRoss: She's not- past, she's present, she's back.\nAunt Lillian: (reentering) What's going on?\nMr. Geller: She may have died.\nAunt Lillian: She may have died?\nMr. Geller: We're looking into it.\n(Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana's room.)\nRoss: I, uh, I'll go see.

I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...\nPhoebe: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.\nRoss: Nono, she's gone.\nMonica: We checked. A lot.\nPhoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.\nRachel: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)\nPhoebe: Thanks!\nRachel: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.\nJoey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?\nPhoebe: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)\n"

I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.\nMonica: That sounds like Nana.\nMrs. Geller: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?\nMonica: ...I can imagine.\nMrs. Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.\nMonica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?\nMrs. Geller: Tell her what?\nMonica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.\nMrs. Geller: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.\nMonica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?\nMrs. Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid.
