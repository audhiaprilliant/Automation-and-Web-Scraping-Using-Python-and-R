We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...\nMonica: So have you called her yet?\nChandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?\nJoey and Ross: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.\nMonica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.\nPhoebe: Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!\nChandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.\nJoey: Her answer machine?\nChandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.\nPhoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?\nChandler: Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o.\"\nMonica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!\nRoss: Okay, okay, what's going on?\nPhoebe: Okay, they're just talking...\nRoss: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?\nPhoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!\nRoss: What? What? What?!\nPhoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!\nChandler: (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.\nAll: Oh!... Right!\nChandler: Hey Rach!\nMonica: How'd it go?\nRachel: Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...\nPhoebe: Not a good day for birds...\nRachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...\nRoss: That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?\nRachel: Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!\nRoss: That's, that's nice twice!\nMonica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?\nJoey: Duh, where've you been?\nRachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?\n(Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.)\nChandler: Yes!\nRachel: Why?\nChandler: I have my reasons.\nMonica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?\nRachel: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!\n"

I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.\nMonica: (looking out the window) Look look!

I feel like I can't do stuff!\nMonica: What kinda stuff?\nJoey: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.\nPhoebe: You cook naked?\nJoey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.\n(A pause as they look at Chandler.)\nChandler: What are you looking at me for?

Hello?\n(Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops.
