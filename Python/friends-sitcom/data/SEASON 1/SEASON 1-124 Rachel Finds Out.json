I'll pay you back this time.\nChandler: (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)\nJoey: Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.\nRoss: (overhearing) What kind of research?\nJoey: Oh, just, y'know.... science.\nRoss: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)\nJoey: (sigh)... It's a fertility study.\n(Rachel laughs.)\nMonica: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.\nJoey: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project.

Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo\u2014it's\u2014it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)\nPhoebe: Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)\nRoss: (to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?\nMonica: Yeah.\n(Phoebe puts the picture of Ross up to her face.)\nPhoebe: Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.\nRoss: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.\nMonica: Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.\nRoss: Oh.

Do you guys know who Carl is?\nChandler: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.\nRoss: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.\nJoey: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?\nChandler: Forget about her.\nJoey: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.\nChandler: Course there, they just call it food.\nRoss: Yeah... I guess. I don't\u2014I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)\nJoey: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.\nRoss: I know.\nJoey: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)\nChandler: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.\n[Time lapse. Melanie, Joey's girlfriend, is there with Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel. Ross is gone.]\nMelanie: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'\nJoey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.\nChandler: (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)\nMonica: (gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?\nRachel: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)\n(Everyone follows Rachel to the living room. Monica pulls Joey aside.)\nMonica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?\nJoey: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...\n(Monica rolls her eyes.)\nJoey: Then you do. Heh, heh.\nMonica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?\nJoey: What do you mean?\nMonica: Y'know, just be there for her.\n(Long pause... Joey looks confused.)\nJoey: Not following you.\nMonica: Think about it.\n(They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.)\nRachel: OK, I'm guessing this is from...\n(Melanie smiles.)\nRachel: Well, thank you, Melanie.\nChandler: (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.\nRachel: (picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)\n(Chandler looks dejected. Rachel picks up another gift.)\nRachel: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!\nPhoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!\nJoey: (to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.\nMelanie: There is a little child inside this man!\nChandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.\n(Rachel picks up the next gift.)\nRachel: Who's this from?\nChandler: Oh, that's Ross's.\nRachel: Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.\nPhoebe: Remembered what?\nRachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!\nChandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)\nPhoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.\nMonica: I can't believe he did this.\nChandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\n(Everyone looks at him. He realizes he just spilled the beans about Ross's crush on Rachel. You can hear this entire classic scene by clicking here.)\nRachel: What did you just say?\nChandler: (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.\nRachel: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?\nChandler: (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....\nRachel: Oh.... my God.\nChandler: (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....\nJoey: (pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.\nCommercial Break\n"

Maybe I'll know when I see him.\nPhoebe: Here, look, alright, does this help?\n(Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.)\nRachel: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.
