Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.\nRachel: Since when?\nJoey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.\nChandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.\nPhoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.\nRachel: And everybody knows this?\nJoey: Yeah. Cushions the blow.\nChandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.\nRoss: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.\nMonica: Uh, Ross.\nRoss: What?

No. Give it to me.\nJoey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.\nChandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.\n(Joey reluctantly gives him the cigarette.)\nChandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right.
