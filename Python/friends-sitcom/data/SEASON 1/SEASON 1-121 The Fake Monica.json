It's just such reckless spending.\nRoss: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.\nChandler: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.\nMonica: That's me.\nPhoebe: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)\nRoss: Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.\nRachel: You're not an artist.\nMonica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff.

Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.\nChandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach.

I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.\nMonica: Wow.
