A brain transplant?!\nJoey: (seriously) Yes, it\u2019s a highly controversial procedure.\nRoss: It\u2019s ridiculous!\nJoey: Well, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that you haven\u2019t had sex in three and a half months.\nRoss: (to Monica and Rachel) It\u2019s winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)\nMonica: Who are they killing off?\nJoey: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.\nRachel and Monica: Noo!!\nMonica: She\u2019s my favorite character on DOOL.\nJoey: Nice.\nRachel: She is so good at throwing drinks in people\u2019s faces, I mean I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her finish a beverage.\nMonica: And the way she slaps all the time!\nRachel: Oh!\nMonica: Wouldn\u2019t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)\nChandler: Don\u2019t do it.\nRachel: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.\nJoey: Oh, tell me about it. And she\u2019s been on the show forever, it\u2019s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.\nRoss: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the \"brain transplant,\" you are going to be her?\nJoey: Yes, but in Drake Remoray\u2019s body.

It\u2019s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?\nCecilia: Certainly.\nMonica: Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.)\nCecilia: I\u2019d love to, but my lawyer said I can\u2019t do that anymore.\nRachel: God. You seem really, really nice.\nJoey: Okay, bye-bye.\nRachel: I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.\nJoey: All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)\nRachel: Okay.\nMonica: (breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia) Umm, you\u2019re a stupid bitch.\nCecilia: I really can\u2019t slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)\nRachel: You are so beautiful.\nMonica: Nice to meet you! My God you\u2019re great!\nJoey: Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I\u2026\nCecilia: Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I\u2019m used to it, don\u2019t worry about it.\nJoey: (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!\nCecilia: What?\nJoey: They sent me today\u2019s script! They never send the script!\nCecilia: They don\u2019t?\nJoey: Well no, I\u2019m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh\u2026\nCecilia: How does it happen?\nJoey: (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.\nCecilia: Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!\nJoey: Yeah well, I\u2019m guessing after this she\u2019s not going to be crazy about electricity either.\n"

And well, Celebration was never meant to be played on the bagpipe, so even the best bag pipe players in the world would have trouble with that particular song. So of course, for a beginner like Ross, it sounds absolutely dreadful. The assembled audience minus Phoebe, are horrified. Phoebe, immune to bad music, seems to enjoy it.)\nRoss: You know the song! Sing along!\n(Ross resumes playing, this time accompanied by Phoebe screeching out E\u2019s in tune with Ross. While Phoebe is singing along, Rachel is having a very difficult time keeping a straight face. Thankfully, Ross gives up after a little while.)\nRoss: So?\nMonica and Chandler: No!\n(Ross throws the bagpipes down in disgust.)\n"

Well how-how, how will you be gone?\nCecilia: Eight months.\nJoey: That\u2019s a really long time.\nCecilia: Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.\nJoey: Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.)
