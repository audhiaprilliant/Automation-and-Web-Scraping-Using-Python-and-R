Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It\u2019s like it was in the stars!\nPhoebe: Yeah, it\u2019s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.\nMonica: What?!\nChandler: What?\nPhoebe: (To Joey) What?!\nChandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?\nMonica: Okay, fine but please don\u2019t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted\u2026just sex.

What are you doing here?\nRachel: I\u2019m just visiting my good friend Carol.\nRoss: Your good friend?\nRachel: Yeah!\nRoss: What\u2019s her last name?\nRachel: Carol\u2026Lesbian?\nRoss: Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?\nRachel: What line?\nRoss: Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) \"Dude, don\u2019t you ever was your face?\"\nRachel: All right, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you but you were so mad already!\nRoss: Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it\u2019s not funny!\nCarol: (entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!\nRoss: Hi.\nCarol: What\u2019s not funny?\nRoss: Practical jokes.\nCarol: Oh I\u2026I think they\u2019re funny.\nRoss: You have a line down your face.\nCarol: What? (Goes and checks.)\nRachel: Okay, maybe they are not funny to you\u2026\nCarol: (yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!\nRachel: Or Carol! But they\u2019re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!\nRoss: Uh, y\u2019know what? I\u2019ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal\u2019s office wearing nothing but a catcher\u2019s mitt!\nRachel: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, \"I will be revenged?!\"\nRoss: I will be! Listen, I don\u2019t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?\nRachel: Fine. Fine, but I\u2019ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I\u2019ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that\u2019s what you want!\nRoss: No that\u2019s not what I want. Uh, I\u2019m glad you guys were bonding but I\u2026\nRachel: Look he doesn\u2019t have any brothers or sisters, somebody\u2019s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven\u2019t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn\u2019t know anyway!\nBen: (yelling from off camera) Crap!!\nRachel: I gotta go! (Runs out.)\n"
