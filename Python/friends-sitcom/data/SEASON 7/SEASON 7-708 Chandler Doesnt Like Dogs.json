No-no-no.\nJoey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh!\nRoss: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?\nChandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.\nRoss: What? That's like insanely easy!\nChandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).\nMonica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.\nRoss: What? You forgot fourteen states?\nMonica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That\u2019s true in so many ways, trust me, I\u2019ve lived in one and been to the other.)\n[Chandler's watch beeps]\nChandler: Oh, okay, time's up!\nRachel: All right, I got 48.\nChandler: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?\nPhoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.\nChandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in\u2026vegetables, Joey?\nJoey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.\nRoss: Wow, how many have you got?\nJoey: Fifty-six!\nOpening Credits\n"

Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.\nMonica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.\nRachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.\nMonica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.\nPhoebe: Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)\nRoss: Done! With time a-to-spare.\nChandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)\nRoss: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called \"a globe?\" Hmm?\nChandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)\nRoss: What? That's impossible.\nJoey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?\nMonica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!\nChandler: I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!\nRoss: No, just give me another minute.\nChandler: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.\nRoss: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.\nChandler: Okay, but if you can't\u2026no dinner!\nRoss: You're on!\nJoey: (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.\nMonica: (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?\nJoey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?\nMonica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?\nRoss: Pshhshhh!\nMonica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)\nChandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.\nJoey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.\n[Chandler and Monica head out with some stuff. Phoebe comes out of her room with a bag.]\nPhoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.\nRoss: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?\nPhoebe: Oh, it's not!\nRachel: Seriously, it's moving!\nJoey: What the hell is in there?\nPhoebe: It's just my knitting that's all!

(Looks around.)\nMonica: I'll be right there!\nPhoebe: (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?\nRachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?\nTag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.\nRachel: Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?\nTag: We kinda broke up this morning.\nRachel: Oh, I'm sorry.\nTag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.\nRoss: Ohio!! Thank you!\n[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]\nChandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!\nRoss: What dog? There-there's no dog here.\nJoey: Yeah that dog left!\nMonica: (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!\nPhoebe: There's no dog in here.\n[The dog barks.]\nChandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!\nPhoebe: No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.\nChandler: What is it doing here?\nPhoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?\nMonica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!\nChandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!\nPhoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days\nChandler: (gasping) Really?\nMonica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?\nChandler: Well, it still has to go, right?\nMonica and Phoebe: Why?\nChandler: Okay, it's um\u2026\nJoey: (interrupting him) Don't do it!\nMonica: Don't do what?\nChandler: (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, \"Do what you have to do\") Okay, I hate dogs.\nAll: What?\nPhoebe: Are you crazy?\nRoss: Are you out of your mind?\nPhoebe: Why?\nJoey: Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)\nChandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.\nRoss: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!\nRachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?\nChandler: (scared) Is there a puppy here?\nTag: You don't like puppies?\nChandler: (to Tag) Okay, you are new!\nJoey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin\u2019 ice cream.\nPhoebe: You don't like ice cream?\nRoss: It's too cold.\nChandler: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.\nRoss: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.\nChandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!\n[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]\nRoss: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.\nMonica: 1250.\nRoss: Damn, I forgot you were here.\nPhoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross\u2019s. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)\nRachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?\nMonica: Yeah.\nRachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?\nPhoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month.\nMonica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4.\nJoey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)\nRachel: Interesting.\nMonica: When it's your assistant, I would say never.\nJoey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.\nRachel: Huh. A moo-point?\nJoey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.\nRachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?\nMonica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he\u2019s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.\nRachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.\nJoey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.\n[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hey!\nTag: Hey.\nRachel: How are you holding up?\nTag: Not bad.\nRachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.\nTag: Thanks.\nRachel: So were you guys together a long time?\nTag: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.\nRachel: Now that she broke up with you?\nTag: Yeah.\nRachel: Yeah. Hmmmm.\nTag: It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?\nRachel: No\u2026Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it\u2026it has to work out.\nTag: Why?\nRachel: Because, uh\u2014it has to.\nTag: You have all the answers, don't you?\nRachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.\nTag: Hey, thanks for talking to me.\nRachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)\nJoey: (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!\nTag: What?\nJoey: (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay...

Why, why would...\nPhoebe: (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.\nChandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y\u2019know, for you, and\u2026(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.

Oh my god!\nMonica: That's right, she came back all by herself.\nPhoebe: It's a Thanksgiving miracle!\nChandler: (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!\nPhoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in\u2026(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?\n[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]\nRoss: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.\nChandler: It's up to you.\n[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.]\nRachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing?\nTag: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.\nRachel: Oh.\nTag: Thanks for having me over, you guys.\nRoss: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?\nTag: Colorado.\nRoss: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)\n[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.]\nRachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.\nTag: Okay.\nRachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It\u2014y\u2019know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?\nTag: Um, I'm not.\nRachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.\nTag: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.\nRachel: Really?\nTag: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
