(She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)\nRoss: There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don\u2019t you just hand over the keys?\nRachel: Oh.\n{Transcriber\u2019s Note: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It\u2019s a tradition left over from Porsche\u2019s racing history. The world\u2019s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver\u2019s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That\u2019s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}\nRoss: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn\u2019t find it.)\nRachel: Look Ross, if you\u2019re so freaked out, just get in the car!\nRoss: With you?! Yeah right!\nRachel: All right. (She starts off.)\nRoss: (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)\nRachel: What are you doing?! Get in the front!\nRoss: In the death seat?!!\nRachel: Oh my\u2026\n(They drive off.)\n"
