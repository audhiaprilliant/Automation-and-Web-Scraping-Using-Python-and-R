It\u2019s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.\nPhoebe: The next, next?\nJoey: Yeah, there\u2019s this guy from Chicago who\u2019s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy\u2019s right after him. (Joey\u2019s cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!\nEstelle: Joey! It\u2019s Estelle!

A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!\nJoey: Well that\u2019s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character\u2019s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.

Y\u2019know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)\nThe Casting Director: Wait Joey! You didn\u2019t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.\nJoey: And scene! Huh? Wasn\u2019t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?\nThe Casting Director: Well, the director thinks you\u2019re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.\nJoey: Wow! Sure! That\u2019s great!\nThe Casting Director: Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.\nJoey: Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it\u2019s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.\nThe Casting Director: Terrific! Well uh, there\u2019s one more thing. Uhh, uh it\u2019s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she\u2019s never seen a naked man who wasn\u2019t Jewish. So\u2026 (Laughs.)\nJoey: So\u2026What?\nThe Casting Director: So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish.

Wow! And it\u2019s definitely all gone? There\u2019s nothing there to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?\nJoey: I don\u2019t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell \u2018em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.\nMonica: Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to\u2026grow a turtleneck!\nJoey: I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.\nMonica: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!\nJoey: I just have to call my agent and tell her I can\u2019t do the part.
