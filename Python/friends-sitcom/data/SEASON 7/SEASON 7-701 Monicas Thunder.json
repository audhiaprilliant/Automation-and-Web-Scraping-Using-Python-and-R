Why?!\nRachel: Because! Because I was sad.\nMonica: What do you mean?\nRachel: Look, I am so\u2026so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not even close. And I don\u2019t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that\u2019s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!\n(Ross looks at Chandler.)\nChandler: (To Ross) I don\u2019t care, she slept with me.\nRachel: Anyway sweetie, I am, I\u2019m so sorry I ruined your night.\nMonica: (starting to cry) I\u2019m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
