And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I\u2019m not looking for a serious relationship; that\u2019d be great.\nRachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!\nJoey: Just casually slip it in, y\u2019know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I\u2019m a loner\u2014No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn\u2019t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.\nRachel: Y\u2019know what? That\u2019s a lot to remember, can\u2019t I just tell her you\u2019re a pig?\nJoey: Hey, I\u2019m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He\u2019d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he\u2019d make extras and leave \u2018em for me.\nRachel: Well forget it, I\u2019m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.\nJoey: Fine! (Pause) Now, where\u2019d we land on those pancakes?

My doctoral dissertation! It\u2019s here! Yeah, it\u2019s right-it\u2019s right down here! In the biggest library in the university!

(They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?\nChandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.\n(They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, let\u2019s just say that clothing is undone.
