When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.\nRachel: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.\nChandler: I\u2014no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.\nRachel: Why, why not?\nChandler: Because it's too delicious.\nRachel: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.\nChandler: No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win!

Are you okay?\nPhoebe: No I\u2019m not okay. The only guy I\u2019ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never\u2026I may never see him again.

Whatever you need.\nPhoebe: Well\u2014But\u2014Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y\u2019know before he does, then he can come back.
