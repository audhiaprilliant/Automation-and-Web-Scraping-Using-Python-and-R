Oh, cute, cute.\nMonica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?\nChandler: You'll get one.\nMonica: Oh yeah? When?\nChandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\nMonica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?\nChandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\nMonica: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?\nChandler: No, no, no.\nMonica: What is it?

Oh God, I thought\u2026 (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you\u2019ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.)

(To Monica) And-and you?!\nMonica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!\nJoey: How?! When?!\nChandler: It happened in London.\nJoey: IN LONDON!!!\nChandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\nJoey: But it is a big deal!!

It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!\nPhoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own\n[Cut to later in that episode. Rachel and Phoebe are going to a movie from Monica and Chandler\u2019s, and as Phoebe walks by Chandler she pinches him on the butt and exits.]\nRachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.\nMonica: Bye!\nAll: Bye!\nPhoebe: Bye Chandler!

Oh I cannot believe those two!\nPhoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!\nJoey: I couldn't even if I wanted too.\n[Cut to later in that episode. Chandler is in his bathroom with Monica, and he\u2019s panicking on how far Phoebe is pushing him.]\nChandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!\nMonica: She's bluffing!\nChandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)\n[Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.]\nPhoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.\nJoey: (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!\nRachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.\nJoey: Ooh!\nRachel: Okay!\nJoey: I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)\nPhoebe: Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn\u2019t rip off any buttons.\nJoey: It's not my first time.\n[Cut to the bathroom.]\nMonica: You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!\nChandler: Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?\nMonica: Of course.\n[Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.]\nChandler: Oh, you're-you're going?\nPhoebe: Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.\nChandler: (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.\nPhoebe: You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.\nChandler: Not if I kiss you first.\n(They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.)\nPhoebe: Ooh.\nChandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\nPhoebe: Here it comes. Our first kiss.\n(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.)\nChandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\nPhoebe: And why not?!\nChandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!\nPhoebe: You're-you're what?!\n(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)\nChandler: Love her! That's right, I\u2026LOVE\u2026HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.\nMonica: I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)\nPhoebe: I just\u2014I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!\nJoey:  So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!\nMonica: Well actually, Ross doesn't.\nChandler: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n[Cut to later in that episode. Ross is showing his boss his new place and notices something in the window.]\nRoss: (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh\u2026 What are you doing?!!
