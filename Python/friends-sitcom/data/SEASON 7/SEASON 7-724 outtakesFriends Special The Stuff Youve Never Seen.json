And I thought, I thought we\u2019d actually take a look at uh, y\u2019know some of these moments where you guys are\u2014there are mistakes. You make mistakes.\nJennifer: Once and a while.\nLisa: From time to time.\nConan: For example, I don\u2019t have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?\nMatthew: Our energy just comes way up when there\u2019s an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn\u2019t, it just doesn\u2019t work.\n[Cut to Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are there. I think it\u2019s The One With The Joke.]\nRoss: Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn\u2019t. I did.\nChandler: Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyone else to laugh.)\n[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is talking.

(Long pause, as everyone cracks up.)\nCourtney: It is one of those days!\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is speaking Italian to Joey\u2019s grandmother.

You know it\u2019s gonna happen.\nThe Director: Once again, and action!\nMonica: (the hand\u2019s still there) When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)\nCourtney: Oh! Okay! I\u2019m gonna try it without the coffee cup \u2018cause I think it\u2019s the left hand that\u2019s messing me up.\n[Reset]\nMonica: When you were little you slept through the Grand\u2014(Pointing again)\u2014Oh fffff\u2026.\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Phoebe are talking.]\nMonica: Sorry, let\u2019s go back! \u2018Cause you\u2019ve got more to say.\nLisa: Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that\u2019s your fault. I\u2026say.\n(They both laugh.)\nLisa: I love you.\nCourtney: I love you! (They hug.)\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nConan: But there must be, there must\u2014are a lot of moments over the years where you\u2019re just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.\n[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, Joey is giving Chandler the bracelet from season 2.]\nJoey: Hey and, this is a little extra something for y\u2019know, always being there for me.\n(Suddenly there\u2019s a noise off stage and the camera on Joey swings around.)\nMatthew: Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!\nMatt: What?!\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Joey are living here and Ross is writing on the Magna-Doodle when Rachel opens the door causing the door knob to hit his hand.]\nDavid: Ahh! Sh\u2014(Beep)\u2014it that hurt!\nJennifer: Are you okay?\n[Reset]\n[When he hears Jennifer try to open the door he jumps back, and Jennifer is unable to open the door this time.]\n[Cut the hallway, Rachel is exited from Monica\u2019s when the door closes on her skirt.]\nChandler: Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monica\u2019s.)\n[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, with the giant entertainment center Joey is exiting from his room.]\nJoey: Oh yeah? Then how come I keep\u2014(He notices that the marker board they use has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery.)\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, first season, Monica is making a giant sub-sandwich and is talking to Rachel. I think it\u2019s The One With Fake Monica.]\nMonica: It was so wild! We told \u2018em we were the Gunderson\u2019s in 16\u2026\n(Jennifer starts laughing.)\nCourtney: (laughing) I spit on her!\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nJennifer: (to Lisa) Operation. You had a fun one.\nLisa: Oh yeah!\nJennifer: With Operation.\nConan: It was a little game.

You mess up.\nMatt: I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call \u2018em.\n[Cut to Central Perk, to the theme from The Dick Van Dyke show Joey runs into Central Perk carrying a stack of Soap Opera Digests and falls on the step. He does bounce right back up making it all that much funnier.]\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nLisa: He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he\u2014(laughs)\u2014he was afraid he was gonna fall down\u2026\nConan: You could actually see him trying not to fall down.\n[Cut to Central Perk, same as before Joey is entering.]\nJoey: Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he didn\u2019t fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nCourtney: This particular time when he continued to fall or y\u2019know, try not to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, \"Should I do it?\"\n[Reset from before, Matt doesn\u2019t fall or look down.]\nJoey: Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands her one.)\nPhoebe: Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!\n(As she\u2019s saying that Joey is to pull out a chair and sit down, only Matthew comes running in from off camera and dives for the same chair.)\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nConan: Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something\u2019s naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?\nMatthew: I don\u2019t necessarily like to juice things\u2026\nCourtney: He said true or false!\n[Cut to Monica\u2019s restaurant kitchen, it\u2019s the episode where Joey is working as a waiter at Monica\u2019s restaurant. Joey is patting her breast from when she set it on fire.]\nJoey: Oh! Ooh-ooh!\nMonica: What are you doing?!\nJoey: You\u2019re still a tiny bit on fire there.\nMonica: Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!\n(Matthew runs in and starts patting the other breast, then walks away. Matt slowly stops patting her breast.)\n[Cut to that same kitchen, only this is The One With The Proposal, Richard is telling Monica something.]\nRichard: It was great seeing you the other night.\nMonica: Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?\nRichard: Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.\n(Suddenly the door flies open and in walks Chandler!!)\nChandler: What the fu\u2014(beep)\u2014ck are you doing?!\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nConan: Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a monkey\u2026\nJennifer: That damn monkey.\nConan: That damn monkey.\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, The One Where The Monkey Gets Away, Rachel is watching a soap opera with Marcel.]\nRachel: Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That\u2019s Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There\u2014(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)\u2014Okay. (And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.)\nJennifer: Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here\u2014Katie! (Katie spills some popcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where she\u2019s supposed to.) Very good.\n[Reset, they\u2019re about to start the scene when Katie suddenly jumps up startling Jennifer.]\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nJennifer: Lisa\u2019s laugh though\u2026There\u2019s\u2014It\u2019s so infectious. It\u2019s one of those things\u2026just forget about it. Once it starts, it\u2019s all gone.\n[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, it\u2019s actually Joey and Rachel\u2019s. Phoebe is trying to convince Rachel to switch with her and live with Monica as Joey looks on.]\nRachel: No y\u2019know, I don\u2019t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!\nPhoebe: Well at Monica\u2019s you can eat\u2014(Suddenly cracks up.)\nLisa: Okay, shh yeah. \u2018Cause it\u2019s not silly.\nThe Director: Here we go.\nJennifer: Okay.\nThe Director: And\u2026action!\nRachel: No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph\u2026 (She starts laughing.)\n[Reset]\nJennifer: (to Lisa) Ready?\nLisa: Yeah.\n(They all start laughing.)\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nConan: And then it just builds on itself and there\u2019s no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.\nDavid: For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when\u2014I mean when\u2026\nConan: (to Matt) You bastard.\nMatt: Yeah, what did I do?\nDavid: \u2026I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I\u2014I mean I find it so funny.\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Ross is eating breakfast with Joey and Monica. Joey is walking towards Ross.]\nJoey: Mornin\u2019\nRoss: Mornin\u2019\n(Joey hugs Ross\u2019s neck and has a look of complete contentment on his face which, after a short while, causes David and Matt to start laughing.)\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Monica is throwing a party. Joey is talking to Ross about the bad audition he just had while pouring booze onto a snow cone.]\nJoey: I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can\u2019t even say, \"Hmm, noodle soup?\"\n(David smiles.)\nMatt: That\u2019s a good one? (They both laugh.)\nDavid: Now, we should go back and take the other line.\nMatt: Okay, I\u2019ll just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some more on.)\nRoss: I think, subconsciously\u2026\nJoey: (cracking up) Nope, you lost me.\n[Reset, Joey is about to pour more booze on.]\nDavid: No!

Now\u2014What is my first line?\nBen: (prompting her) What did we agree?\nJennifer: Okay\u2026\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nDavid: The good thing about the young kids though, they\u2019re completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story\u2026\nJennifer: Oh little Ben.\nDavid: Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to hear my son\u2019s first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show\u2026\n[Cut to Central Perk, Ross is taking Ben to visit Rachel who\u2019s working there.]\nRoss: Hi!

Like, do you remember that one where Monica\u2019s baking cookies in our old apartment?\nJennifer: She\u2019s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.\nMatt: Yeah, she\u2019s trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and we\u2019re sitting there eating pizza and I think it was you (Points to Lisa) that said\u2026\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, the scene described above.]\nPhoebe: What do I smell?\n[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]\nMatt: I think I was supposed to say, \"I don\u2019t know,\" and go over and open the door.

And it\u2019ll just\u2014the way you say the word is funny to everybody else.\n[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, is the one where Rachel screwed up the desert and Ross and Joey are trying to enjoy it.]\nRoss: That tastes like feet!\n(David puts his napkin up to his mouth and starts laughing at his own line.
