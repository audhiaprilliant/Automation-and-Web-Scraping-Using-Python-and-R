What made you do it?!\nRachel: Well, it\u2019s a long story, but umm I broke Joey\u2019s chair\u2026\nChandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey\u2019s chair?\nRachel: Yeah.\nChandler: I thought I broke Joey\u2019s chair! That\u2019s why I replaced it with mine!\nRachel: Ohhhhh. That\u2019s how it got fixed!\nChandler: Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?\nRachel: Noo! (Laughs) Angels.\nChandler: I\u2019m gettin\u2019 my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachel\u2019s.)\nRachel: What? Wh-hey!\n(They enter Joey and Rachel\u2019s to find that Joey has broken Chandler\u2019s chair.)\nJoey: Well, it looks like it wasn\u2019t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)\nChandler: Joey you broke my chair!!\nJoey: Your chair?!\nRachel: Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!\nJoey: So, there was no miracle?!\nRachel: No Joe, no miracle.\nJoey: (sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I\u2019m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.\nRachel: Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don\u2019t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!\nChandler: I think I should get the chair!\n(Rachel and Joey both laugh at that suggestion.)\nJoey: How do you figure?\nChandler: Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn\u2019t broke a chair, is me!\nRachel: No-no-no! This chair\u2019s not going anywhere.\nChandler: Well, where\u2019s the logic in that?!\nRachel: The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!\nChandler: So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!\n(Joey whispers in Rachel\u2019s ear to confirm his response.)\nJoey: That\u2019s right!\nChandler: What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!\n(They confer again.)\nJoey: Yeah! We are!\n(Rachel whispers in Joey\u2019s ear.)\nRachel: We\u2019re the Cobras!\n"

I can\u2019t let you do it!\nEarl: Why?!\nPhoebe: Because it was fate that made me call you today!\nEarl: I thought it was toner.\nPhoebe: No! Think about it okay? This isn\u2019t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you\u2019re my first call! And-and somebody else might\u2019ve hung up on you, but I wouldn\u2019t do that because I know about this stuff.

Well umm, okay here\u2019s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.\nEarl: I\u2019m actually the office manager.\nPhoebe: Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.\nEarl: Well, was there anything else?!\nPhoebe: Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?\nEarl: Philadelphia.\nPhoebe: Oh my God!

These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!\nEarl: (To All) Did you hear that?! I don\u2019t need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (To Phoebe) I really wished they\u2019d care just a little bit though.\nPhoebe: Y\u2019know, I don\u2019t-I don\u2019t think it\u2019s you. This is a freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it\u2019s you.\nEarl: Yeah.\n"
