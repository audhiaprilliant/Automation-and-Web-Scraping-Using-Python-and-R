It took three guys to get the thing in there!\nPhoebe: If you don\u2019t sail your boat, what do you do on it?\nJoey: Oh, it\u2019s great! It\u2019s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.

Why didn\u2019t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!\nPhoebe: (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I\u2019m normal!

I bet I can do it.\n(Chandler looks over and sees Ross glaring at them.)\nChandler: Okay, we owe you a present.\nRoss: Two!

We\u2019re not finished with the lesson yet.\nJoey: All right.\nRachel: Okay, I\u2019m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?\nJoey: Come on Rach, not again. I got it!

(Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.)

We just went over this! (She does it instead.)\nJoey: Oh, y\u2019know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it?
