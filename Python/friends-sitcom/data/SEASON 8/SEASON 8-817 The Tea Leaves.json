Don\u2019t tell her I\u2019m here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don\u2019t eat that!

(To Monica) Do you see him?\nMonica: I don\u2019t see him. Hey! Maybe he\u2019s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)\nRachel: Well, at least you make each other laugh.\nMonica: What\u2019s up?\nRachel: Well, I haven\u2019t seen him since that night that he told me how he y\u2019know\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I think he\u2019s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?\nMonica: We were playing a game.\nRachel: Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?\nMonica: Sure.\nChandler: What?! No! No!\nRachel: All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh\u2026tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)\nMonica: (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?\nJoey: Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a pretty small hole.\nMonica: Honey, you gotta talk to her.\nJoey: I can\u2019t! Y\u2019know? You guys don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.\nChandler: (incredulous) I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \"I love you,\" was, \"Oh crap!\"\nMonica: Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they\u2019re hungry.\nJoey: All right so, so what do I do?\nMonica: This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s awkward, but you gotta at least try.\nJoey: Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your\u2026\nChandler: (interrupting him) We didn\u2019t play it!!\nOpening Credits\n"

I love that shirt!\nRachel: Well just ask Mona to give it back!\nRoss: I don\u2019t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I\u2019d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.

We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he\u2019s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)\nChandler: Phoebe, did you see that?!

That makes sense.\nMonica: Yeah, like I don\u2019t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.\nRachel: Ooh, I can do that.\nMonica: Good.

(Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife\u2014They-they can\u2019t have children. So umm, and that\u2014we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, \"Rachel, I want to buy your baby.\"\nJoey: Man!
