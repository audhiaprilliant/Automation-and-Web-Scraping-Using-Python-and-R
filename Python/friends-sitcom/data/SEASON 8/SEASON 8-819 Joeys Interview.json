They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.\nRoss: Why\u2019d you say no?\nJoey: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.\nChandler: If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)\nRachel: Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y\u2019know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don\u2019t know, gal pal Rachel Green?\nChandler: Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?\nRachel: Okay, don\u2019t listen to him. Please?\nJoey: Fine! All right, I\u2019ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y\u2019know, start to say something stupid.\nRoss: Just then or-or all the time, \u2018cause we-we have jobs y\u2019know.\nRachel: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I\u2019m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.)

She\u2019s sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)\n[The next one is from Episode 613: The One With Rachel\u2019s Sister, Chandler has just opened the door to reveal a woman standing there.]\nWoman: Hi, is Rachel here? I\u2019m her sister.\nRachel: Oh my God, Jill!\nJill: Oh my God, Rachel!\n(They run and hug each other.)\nChandler: Oh my God, introduce us!\nRachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)\nJill: Hi!\nRachel: And you know Monica and Ross!\nRoss: Hi Jill.\nRachel: And that\u2019s Phoebe (points), and that\u2019s Joey.\nJoey: Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin\u2019?\nRachel: Don\u2019t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)\n[The final one is from Episode 607: The One Where Phoebe Runs, Joey has been trying to repel Janice and sees it\u2019s not working to his liking so he\u2019s confronting her about the sexual tension.]\nJanine: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.\nJoey: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.\nJanine: I don't think so.\nJoey: Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?\nJanine: I'm okay.\nJoey: What?!?! Oh dear God!\n[Cut to the interview.]\nJoey: Not much to tell there I\u2019m really shy.\n(The gang is confused.)\nThe Interviewer: So, that\u2019s it. I guess that\u2019s all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.\nJoey: Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)\nThe Interviewer: Bye.\nJoey: Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) I did it!\nRachel: Yeah!\nRoss: Amazing! Amazing!\nThe Interviewer: (returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what\u2019s your favorite soap opera?\nJoey: Oh, I don\u2019t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y\u2019know?\n(The gang is disappointed.)\nThe Interviewer: Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.\nJoey: Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!\nClosing Credits\n"

This picture of you sure is steamy.\nJoey: Oh yeah, that\u2019s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
