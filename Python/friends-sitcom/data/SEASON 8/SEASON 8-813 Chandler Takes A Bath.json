What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.\nMonica: How dirty do you think I am? I\u2019m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.\nChandler: Honey, it\u2019s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I\u2019m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?\nJoey: (entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.\nChandler: Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?\nJoey: Well, neither.\nChandler: Oh my God, what\u2019s up?!\nJoey: I don\u2019t know.

(Starts to leave)\nChandler: Oh no-no, no you don\u2019t, just come back.\nJoey: All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that\u2019s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?\nChandler: Do you?\nJoey: It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?\nChandler: In London?\nJoey: Yeah.\nChandler: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.\nJoey: You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.\nChandler: If that.\n"

And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.\nMonica: Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently.

I got a new one, like, a month ago.\nPhoebe: Oh, just as well, I broke this one.\n(Monica starts smiling)\nPhoebe: What?\nMonica: Nothing.\nPhoebe: Okay.\nMonica: I mean, I-I, I really shouldn\u2019t say.

Joey?! You don\u2019t say.\nMonica: Is it something you\u2019d be interested in?\nPhoebe: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y\u2019know on the other hand\u2026 No. No, I can\u2019t. We\u2019re friends. No, oh, no. I don\u2019t want to risk what we have.\nMonica: I guess that makes sense. So, you think you\u2019re going to talk to him?\nPhoebe: Sure, yeah. I mean, it\u2019s Joey. I don\u2019t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire!
