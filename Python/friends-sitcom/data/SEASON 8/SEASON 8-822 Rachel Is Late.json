They were like, \"Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby.\" Well y\u2019know what? Screw \u2018em! If they don\u2019t want me there, I\u2019ll just hang out with you guys.\nPhoebe: Or you can do volunteer work.\n(Joey\u2019s cell phone rings and he answers it.)\nJoey: Hello?\nEstelle: Joey! It\u2019s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.\nJoey: One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!\nEstelle: Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You\u2019ll be sitting next to HotGuy372.\nJoey: Oh my God. So that\u2019s it?! I only get to bring one guest?\nEstelle: Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?\nJoey: (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.\nRachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?\nJoey: You said you didn\u2019t want to go.\nRachel: I don\u2019t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I\u2019m pregnant you think I\u2019m invisible.\nJoey: Definitely not invisible.\nMonica: Well, well Ross didn\u2019t care enough to be here, so I think he\u2019s out. You snooze you lose.\nChandler: He\u2019s not snoozing, he\u2019s teaching a class.\nMonica: Well then somebody\u2019s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)\nChandler: I haven\u2019t seen this dress.\nMonica: Star in a movie.\nPhoebe: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.)

(Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)\nChandler: You really want to take me?\nJoey: Yeah! Yeah! I mean I\u2019m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y\u2019know Chandler always supported my career. He\u2019s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.\nChandler: So you\u2019re never actually going to pay me back?\nMonica: Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you\u2019re gonna take him? Joey, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!\nJoey: It\u2019s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it\u2019s-it\u2019s everything. Y\u2019know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn\u2019t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn\u2019t believe in myself.\nChandler: I always knew you were gonna make it. I\u2019m so proud of you.\nJoey: Thanks. That means a lot to me.\n(They look at each other and smile for a while.)\nPhoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.\nJoey: (in a manly voice) I\u2019m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)\nChandler: (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I\u2019m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)\nRachel: Oh, I have to pee. If I don\u2019t come out in five minutes it\u2019s because I\u2019ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)\nPhoebe: When she comes out, you hold her nose, I\u2019ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.\nMonica: She\u2019s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?\nPhoebe: I don\u2019t know. I-I think it\u2019s still gonna be a while.\nMonica: Hmm, care to make it interesting? I\u2019ll bet you that she\u2019ll have it by this time tomorrow.\nPhoebe: You\u2019re on!\nMonica: Okay, how much?\nPhoebe: One hundred thousand dollars!\nMonica: How about fifty bucks?\nPhoebe: Fine! I\u2019ll call Zurich and move some money around.\nRachel: (calling from the bathroom) All right, who\u2019s turn is it to help me get up!\n(They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.)\nPhoebe: No one\u2019s here!
