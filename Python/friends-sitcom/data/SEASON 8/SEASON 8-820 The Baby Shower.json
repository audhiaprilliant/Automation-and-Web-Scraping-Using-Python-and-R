You mean they\u2019re not coming to a social event where there\u2019s no men and there\u2019s no booze?! That\u2019s shocking!

My mom\u2019s not gonna be here?!\nMonica: Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.\nRachel: My God!\nMonica: Well it wasn\u2019t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!\nPhoebe: Well I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t have a mother so often I forget that other people\u2026\nMonica: (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!\nRachel: So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!\nPhoebe: No. (Pause) Neither is mine.\nMonica: Okay, y\u2019know what?

Hi, it\u2019s Monica Geller.\nMrs. Green: Oh, hello Monica.\nMonica: (on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we\u2019ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.\nMrs. Green: I know, my daughter\u2019s told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.\nMonica: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m-I\u2019m so sorry.\nMrs. Green: For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?\nMonica: (To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please! Can you come? It\u2019s today at four.\nMrs. Green: Well all right. I\u2019ll see you at four.\nMonica: Thank you. (Hangs up.)\nPhoebe: Isn\u2019t it at three?\nMonica: Son of a bitch!

Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don\u2019t you tell us a little something about you Ross?\nRoss: Well uh, I-I\u2019m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh\u2026\nJoey: I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?\nChandler: Well Joey, I\u2019m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)\nJoey: Excellent! Let\u2019s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you\u2019ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?\nChandler: Bogota.\nJoey: It\u2019s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.\nChandler: What does a Wicked Wango card do?\nJoey: I should know that. Let\u2019s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.\nChandler: Higher or lower than what?\nJoey: This is embarrassing.

What\u2019s this?\nWoman: It\u2019s a diaper genie.\nRachel: Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!\nWoman: No! It\u2019s where you put the dirty ones!\nRachel: Well that\u2019s gross, why don\u2019t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?\nMrs. Green: Oh you\u2019re gonna do that ten times a day?\nRachel: What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!\nMrs. Green: No dear, that\u2019s what babies do.\nMonica: Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.\nMrs. Green: Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you\u2019re trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?\nRachel: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d leave it on the changing table?

I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would\u2014she wouldn\u2019t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y\u2019know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I\u2019m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming.
