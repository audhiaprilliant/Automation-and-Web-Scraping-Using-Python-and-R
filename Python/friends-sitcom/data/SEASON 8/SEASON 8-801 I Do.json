Look honey y\u2019know what? I haven\u2019t told him yet, so until I do I don\u2019t think I should tell anybody else.\nPhoebe: Yeah. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fair.

Look, what\u2019s more important, the way I\u2019m dressed or me being with you on your special day?\nMonica: Honey, I\u2019m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)\n[Cut to the hallway outside the room, Ross is going to see which table he\u2019s at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]\nRoss: Hi. I\u2019m uh, I\u2019m Ross. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met. I\u2019m Monica\u2019s older brother.\nWoman: Oh hi, I\u2019m, I\u2019m Mona from her restaurant.\nRoss: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.\nMona: You think so? I\u2019ve always kinda hated it.\nRoss: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?\nMona: Uh-huh.\nRoss: Mona umm\u2026Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she\u2019s uh\u2014well she\u2019s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.\nMona: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.\nRoss: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.\nMona: Oh good. Now there\u2019ll be someone there who likes my name.\nRoss: (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you\u2019ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it\u2019s all right with you I\u2019m gonna take your place at table six\u2014Martin Clickclocken.\n[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]\nJoey: That\u2019s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)\n[Cut to Chandler sitting down near Joey as his mom walks over.

I\u2019d like you to meet Dennis Phillips.\nDennis Phillips: Congratulations.\nChandler: Thank you.\nMrs. Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.\nChandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.\nDennis Phillips: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.\nMrs. Bing: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.\nJoey: I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met, Joey Tribbiani.\nDennis Phillips: Dennis Phillips\nJoey: Wow, I\u2019ve admired your work for years. You-you\u2019ve done some really amazing stuff.\nDennis Phillips: Oh, thank you. Well if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)\nJoey: Wow Dennis Phillips! That\u2019s great! How did you guys meet?\nMrs. Bing: Well, it\u2019s a funny story.\nChandler: Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)\n[Time lapse.

Well I\u2019m\u2026 (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.\n[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]\nJoey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? \u2018Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would\u2019ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that\u2019s just for ugly people.\nChandler: What size shoes do you wear?\nJoey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.\nChandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?\nJoey: Uh, I don\u2019t even really know where I left those. Sorry.\nChandler: (looking at Joey\u2019s feet) Those aren\u2019t eleven and a half.\nJoey: Okay fine! I\u2019m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I\u2019ll show ya!\n[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]\nMonica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!\nRachel: Oh y\u2019know what honey? Let\u2019s not talk about that right now?\nMonica: This is so huge.\nRachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?\nMonica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and you\u2026\nRachel: Yeah.\nMonica: \u2026in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?\nRachel: Hey! Y\u2019know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they\u2019re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!\nMonica: How?\nRachel: I don\u2019t know! Maybe they have tools.\nMonica: Well I-I talked to and uh, she\u2019s definitely going to have this baby. Y\u2019know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.\nRachel: Well, maybe that\u2019s, maybe that\u2019s really brave.\nMonica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it\u2019s gonna be.\nRachel: Maybe she hasn\u2019t really thought it through that well.\nMonica: Well, there\u2019s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she\u2019s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?\nRachel: (starting to cry) I don\u2019t know.\nMonica: Are you okay?\nRachel: Uh-hmm. I\u2019m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.\nWaiter: Champagne?\nRachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn\u2019t work.)

Now he just thinks I\u2019m a soap actor.\nChandler: But you\u2019re not just a soap actor.

I was like, (overly angry) \"Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!\" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I\u2019m sorry. And-and some scared memories\u2014Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I\u2019ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!\n[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]\nBandleader: Thank you.\nRoss: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.\nAshley: Can we do it again?\nRoss: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)\nMona: So, is it my turn now?\n(A large little fat girl walks over.)\nFat Girl: I\u2019m next!\nRoss: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)\nMona: Uh, that\u2019s okay. You can dance with her first.\nRoss: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what\u2019s uh, what\u2019s your name.\nFat Girl: Gert!\nRoss: That\u2019s, that\u2019s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross\u2019s feet, but he pulls them out of harm\u2019s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?\nGert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.\nRoss: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)\nGert: Why aren\u2019t you moving your feet?\nRoss: I\u2019m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)\nGert: Faster! You\u2019re not going fast enough!\nRoss: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert\u2019s shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)\n[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]\nJoey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?\nDennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?\nJoey: Well, I\u2019d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you\u2019re casting for this new show\u2026\nDennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite right for this project.\nJoey: Oh, see that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn\u2019t see it up there, just-just try me.\nDennis Phillips: It\u2019s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?\nJoey: Well I\u2019m not proud of this, but\u2026 (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)\nDennis Phillips: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don\u2019t-don\u2019t-don\u2019t!\n[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]\nMonica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?\nChandler: Did it turn into sand?\nMonica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you\u2019ll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)\nChandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I won\u2019t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn\u2019t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.\nMonica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn\u2019t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.\n(Mr. Geller dances over.)\nMr. Geller: Chandler, I\u2019m gonna have you arrested.\nChandler: Why?\nMr. Geller: You stole my moves.
