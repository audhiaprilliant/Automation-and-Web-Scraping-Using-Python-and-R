I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That\u2019s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He\u2019ll find me.\nPhoebe: Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?\nChandler: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don\u2019t think they exist.\nPhoebe: Okay, good.\nChandler: Why?\nPhoebe: Well last night, I met Monica\u2019s.\nChandler: What?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.\nChandler: Come on, don\u2019t be crazy.
