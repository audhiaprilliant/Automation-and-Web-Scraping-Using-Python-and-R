(Sits up) Who said that?\nPhoebe: Yeah, he\u2019s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.\nMonica: (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?\nRoss: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?\nMonica: Yeah, I\u2019d really like to.\nRoss: Okay, hopefully this time mom won\u2019t boo you.\nMonica: Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it\u2019s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I\u2019m going to make them cry.\nChandler: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?\nMonica: No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \"God, your brother.\" Know what they\u2019ll say this year? \"God, you\"\nJoey: Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to himself) I\u2019m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)\nMonica: Really you can do that?\nJoey: Are you kidding me? Watch!

Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts hand on her stomach)\nRachel: I, uh, think you already are.\nParker: Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than\u2014Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?\nMonica: That\u2019s my old dog. He passed away years ago.\nParker: Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where\u2019s the party?\nMonica: It\u2019s out on the island. It\u2019s in Massapequa.\nParker: Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber\u2019s Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.}\nRoss: Well, there is an Arby\u2019s in the shape of a tee-pee.\nMonica: Okay, I got my note cards.

You can do this.\nRoss: Can you believe that?\nRachel: Yeah, if you\u2019re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.\nRoss: No, us having to lie about being married.\nRachel: No, I know I don\u2019t either, but ya know what, it\u2019s their party, and it\u2019s just one night. And we don\u2019t even have to lie; we just won\u2019t say anything. If it comes up again, we\u2019ll just\u2026smile.

What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C\u2026I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don\u2019t want to forget this moment! It\u2019s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental picture of them all.)\nChandler: I don\u2019t think the flash went off.\nParker: Dahaaa!

Ooh sorry\u2026(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)\nPhoebe: Were you guys making fun of Parker?\nRoss: That depends, how much did you hear?\nPhoebe: So, he a little enthusiastic, what\u2019s wrong with that?\nMonica: It\u2019s just that, it\u2019s so much.\nPhoebe: Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you\u2019ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don\u2019t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? \u2018Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who\u2019s who of human crap.

That\u2019s a great story.\nRoss: Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That\u2019s-that\u2019s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower\u2026\nAunt Lisa: Oh that is so sweet!\nRachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!\nRoss: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \"Will you marry me?\"\n(Various oohs and ahhs)\nRachel: And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!\n(Cut to Phoebe and Joey)\nJoey: Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker\u2019s a nice guy and I\u2019d like to get to know him.\nPhoebe: Then you better do it now.\nJoey: Why?\nPhoebe: Because I\u2019m going to kill him\nJoey: What-what?\nPhoebe: You guys were right. He\u2019s just too excited about\u2026everything. I mean I\u2019m all for living life, but this is the Geller\u2019s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let\u2019s call a spade a spade this party stinks.\nJoey: I know I\u2019m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!\nPhoebe: Are you sure it wasn\u2019t an oyster?\nJoey: I guess it could\u2019ve been, I didn\u2019t really look at it. Y\u2019know, I just wiped it on Chandler\u2019s coat and got the hell out of there.\nPhoebe: He\u2019s just such a great guy I\u2019m so excited about him.\nJoey: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There\u2019s nothing wrong with him he\u2019s a good guy.\nPhoebe: You think?\nJoey: Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.\nPhoebe: You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right, he\u2019s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I\u2019m a sunny, positive person.\nJoey: Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.\nPhoebe: What\u2019s that now?\nJoey: Nothing\u2026\nPhoebe: Oh look it\u2019s Parker!\nParker: Look! It\u2019s the bunny hop!\nPhoebe: Oooh I love it!\nParker: You do?!\nPhoebe: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!\n(Cut to Monica, at the microphone)\nMonica: Okay it\u2019s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I\u2019m going to do it.\n(Everyone sighs)\nMonica: No, no it\u2019s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don\u2019t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I\u2019m-I\u2019m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can\u2019t because she\u2019s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she\u2019s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn\u2019t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesn\u2019t get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Here\u2019s to mom and dad! Whatever!\nMrs. Geller: Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn\u2019t it interesting, Jack?\nMr. Geller: (looking at the picture) Why don\u2019t I remember this dog?\nMrs. Geller: Ross, why don\u2019t you give us your toast now?\nRoss: Oh, no, Mom, it\u2019s just Monica this year.\nMrs. Geller: You\u2019re not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary\nRoss: No, of course, Um\u2026 Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say\u2026on behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if\u2026if in 35 years, we\u2019re half as happy as you guys are, we\u2019ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.\nMrs. Geller: (crying) Oh Ross\u2026\nMr. Geller: I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross\u2019s toast.\n"
