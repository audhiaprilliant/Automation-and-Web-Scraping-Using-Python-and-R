Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y\u2019know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.\nKids: Trick or treat!!\nRachel: (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)\nWitch: Thank you.\nRachel: And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)\nClown: Thank you.\nRachel: (to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y\u2019know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don\u2019t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but\u2026\nCowgirl: (interrupting) Can I just have the candy?\nRachel: Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe, dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)\nPhoebe: Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.\nMonica: So we do Supergirl.\nPhoebe: No, it\u2019s me. Phoebe!\nChandler: (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume\u2026\nRachel: (To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?\nMonica: What?! I thought he\u2019d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!\nChandler: The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!\nMonica: Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.\nChandler: No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!\nJoey: (entering) Hey!\nMonica: You didn\u2019t dress up either?!\nJoey: Yes I did! I\u2019m Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?\nChandler: How is that me?\nJoey: Okay. I\u2019m Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)\nPhoebe: (To Chandler) That is so you!\nChandler: When have I ever done that?!\nJoey: When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)\n(There\u2019s a knock on the door.)\nGirl: Trick or treat!\nRachel: Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you\u2019re just the prettiest ballerina I\u2019ve ever seen.\nBallerina: Thank you. (Pirouettes.)\nRachel: Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.\nBallerina: Thank you. (Does another ballerina move.)\nRachel: Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.\nBallerina: I love you! (Hugs Rachel.)\nRachel: Ohh\u2026 Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?\nMonica: What?! There\u2019s only been like four kids.\nRachel: Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.\nPhoebe: No wonder your pregnant.\nRoss: (entering) Hey! (He\u2019s wearing a costume as well.)\nRachel: Hey.\nMonica: What are you supposed to be?\nRoss: Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, I\u2019m a potato or a\u2026spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he\u2019s wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes\u2026 (They\u2019re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!\nChandler: Wow! I don\u2019t have the worst costume anymore!\nJoey: (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.\nRoss: No, I-I\u2019m not doody.\nMonica: No, space doody!\n(Joey gives him the okay symbol, and Ross rushes towards him to be stopped by Chandler. Meanwhile, Phoebe goes over to the snack table as some guy, which turns out to be Ursula's fianc\ufffde Eric, walks in and smacks her butt.)\nEric: Aren\u2019t you gonna give me a kiss?\nPhoebe: Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.\nEric: Ursula?\nPhoebe: Ursula\u2019s fianc\ufffde?\nEric: Oh my God, you\u2019re the sister!\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nEric: Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law\u2019s ass.\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nEric: I\u2019m an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.\nPhoebe: My mother killed herself.\nEric: She, now I knew that and\u2026now I\u2019m sweating. Look at me, I\u2019m really sweating\u2014Now I\u2019m saying, \"Look at me,\" I\u2019m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.\nPhoebe: No-no! That\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I\u2019m Phoebe.\nEric: Eric. (They shake hands and he\u2019s squinting. And, no, it\u2019s not me.)\nPhoebe: Why are you looking at me like that?\nEric: \u2018Cause the sweat\u2019s getting in my eyes and its burning.\nPhoebe: Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?\nEric: I don\u2019t think they have a name for it. It\u2019s just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.\nPhoebe: (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.\nEric: Oh umm, I\u2019m the solar system. (He\u2019s wearing a black sweater with the planets glued on around the sun.) Yeah, my students helped me make it\u2014I teach the second grade.\nPhoebe: I love the second grade!\nEric: Really?\nPhoebe: Yeah! It\u2019s so much better than first grade when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y\u2019know with all the politics and mind games.\nEric: So what do you do?\nPhoebe: Umm, I\u2019m a masseuse\u2026by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)\nEric: Y\u2019know you don\u2019t have to stand here with me, believe me\u2026\nPhoebe: No I\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m really\u2014And I\u2019m really-really excited for you and Ursula.\nEric: Oh I feel very lucky, she\u2019s great. I think she\u2019s the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\nPhoebe: Thank you.\n[Time lapse, Monica is going over to talk to Joey.]\nMonica: Hey Joey?\nJoey: Yeah.\nMonica: You read comic books right?\nJoey: Exclusively.\nMonica: Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?\nJoey: Catwoman, hands down.\nMonica: Yeah\u2026\nJoey: But between you and Phoebe, I\u2019d have to give the edge to Phoebe.\nMonica: What?! Really?!\nJoey: Are you kiddin\u2019? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she\u2019s got this crazy temper. She\u2014She\u2019s not standing right behind me is she?\nMonica: No you\u2019re fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?\nJoey: I\u2019m not sure.\nMonica: What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!\nJoey: Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn\u2019t matter.\nMonica: Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y\u2019know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?\nJoey: I would say, \"Woman, please!\"\nPhoebe: (walking over) Hey. Ursula\u2019s fianc\ufffde is really sweet! He\u2019s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y\u2019know normally y\u2019know, I don\u2019t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!\nMonica: Oh my God, Phoebe!\nPhoebe: What?\nMonica: You\u2019re getting a crush on your sister\u2019s fianc\ufffde.\nPhoebe: No I\u2019m not! You are!\nJoey: (To Monica) Here comes the temper.\n(There\u2019s a knock on the door and Rachel opens it to a little girl.)\nGirl: Trick or treat!\nRachel: Hi! Y\u2019know what honey, we\u2019re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I\u2019m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?\nGirl: Okay!\nRachel: Okay, what\u2019s your name?\nGirl: Lelani Mayolanofavich.\nRachel: Okay, I\u2019m just gonna write this out to cash.\nMona: (entering) Hi!\nRachel: Hey Mona!\nChandler: Oh! Hi!\nMona: Hi!\nChandler: Joey\u2019s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you\u2019d come by as a slutty nurse.\nMona: Umm, actually I\u2019m just a nurse.\nChandler: You\u2019d think that would embarrass me, but you see I\u2019m maxed out.\nRoss: Hey!\nMona: Hi!\nRoss: You made it!\nMona: Wait-wait! You\u2019re umm, you\u2019re a potato\u2026\nRoss: Well, I\u2019m a spud\u2026\nMona: And the antennae\u2026Oh my God you\u2019re Spudnik!\nRoss: Yes!\nChandler: (To Ross) Marry her.\n[Cut to Joey and Monica.]\nJoey: Okay, here\u2019s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.\nMonica: I can\u2019t answer that! Chandler\u2019s my husband.\nJoey: So Ross?\nMonica: Yeah.\n[Cut to Phoebe and Eric.]\nEric: Hey beautiful.\nPhoebe: Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?\nEric: Two weeks ago.\nPhoebe: Two weeks? That\u2019s it?\nEric: Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it\u2019s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she\u2019s just so perfect, and we have so much in common.\nPhoebe: Oh really?\nEric: We\u2019re both teachers.\nPhoebe: Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)\nEric: And we were both in the Peace Corps.\nPhoebe: Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, \"I don\u2019t know.\")\nEric: In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.\nUrsula: Yeah. It wasn\u2019t a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. (To Eric) Shall we get me really drunk?\nEric: Sure.\n(They walk away.)\n[Cut to Mona and Ross walking past Chandler.]\nChandler: Howdy doody.\nRoss: That\u2019s funny. Yeah. Y\u2019know you\u2019re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.\nChandler: Oh relax man, relax. You\u2019re looking a little flushed.\nJoey: (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.\nChandler: What question?\nJoey: Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?\nChandler: There\u2019s no question.\nJoey: So you think Ross too?\n(Monica turns around slowly.)\nChandler: (To Monica) You picked Ross?!\nMonica: Ross is really strong! Okay, he\u2019s the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.\nChandler: I cannot believe you didn\u2019t pick me.\nRoss: Uh, in her defense, she\u2019s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.\nChandler: Oh really?! You think you\u2019re stronger? Why don\u2019t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)\nRoss: Oh I\u2019ll prove it! I\u2019ll prove it like a theorem!!\n(They start to fight with Ross pulling on Chandler\u2019s ears and Chandler hitting Ross over the head with his carrot.)\nMonica: Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one\u2019s gonna fight in this apartment.\nJoey: Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let\u2019s give \u2018em what they came for!\nMona: Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.\nJoey: Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.\nChandler: (To Ross) You\u2019re going down.\nRoss: Oh yeah? You\u2019re going further down!

Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here\u2019s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this.

I just wanted so much to\u2026be impulsive once. To be romantic.\nPhoebe: That\u2019s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just\u2026you did it with the wrong person.

Are you scared?\nMonica: Let\u2019s go big bunny!\n(They assume the starting position.)\nChandler: Okay. 1\u20262\u20263\u2014Go! (Once again he\u2019s at a stalemate, but this time he\u2019s in pain.) (Pause) I\u2019m gonna kill myself!\nEnd\n"
