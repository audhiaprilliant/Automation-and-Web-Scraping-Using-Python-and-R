(Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that\u2019s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I\u2019m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.\nPhoebe: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?\nRachel: Yeah.\nPhoebe: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.\nRachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?\nPhoebe: Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y\u2019know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.\nRachel: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa\u2019s lap.\nPhoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.\nRachel: Ah.\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nRachel: Well, y\u2019know what?
