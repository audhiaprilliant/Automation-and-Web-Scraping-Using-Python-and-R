Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)\nJoey: (laughing) You fall for it every time!\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Hi!\nPhoebe: I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)\nRachel: Oh Pheebs that\u2019s so sweet\u2014(Grabs a pair of pants)\u2014Ooh, those are so cute!\nPhoebe: Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There\u2019s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby\u2019s born, they\u2019re great for shoplifting melons.\nMonica: (entering) Oh good you\u2019re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o\u2019clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?\nRachel: No.\nMonica: He was in Ross\u2019s class\u2026marching band\u2026kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.\nRachel: Wow! I don\u2019t remember him. Honey, are you sure you\u2019re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.\nMonica: No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven\u2019t thought about him in a long time\u2026 (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Will\u2019s, Will\u2019s here on business and he didn\u2019t have a place to go so I invited him here.\nRachel: Oh that\u2019s nice.\nMonica: Oh, and by the way, he\u2019s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.\nJoey: I just want you to say it once in a while.\nMonica: All right okay, just so you know, I\u2019m not gonna make a turkey this year.\nJoey: What?!\nMonica: Well Phoebe doesn\u2019t eat turkey\u2026\nJoey: Phoebe!\nPhoebe: Turkey\u2019s are beautiful, intelligent animals!\nJoey: No they\u2019re not! They\u2019re ugly and stupid and delicious!\nMonica: All right! Okay, it\u2019s just Phoebe. Will\u2019s still on a diet, Chandler doesn\u2019t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel\u2019s having her aversion to poultry.\nJoey: She is?\nRachel: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?\nJoey: Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.\nMonica: Anyway, it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It\u2019s a lot of work.\nJoey: But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!\nMonica: All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just\u2014there\u2019s gonna be a ton left over.\nJoey: No there won\u2019t! I promise I will finish that turkey!\nMonica: All right, you\u2019re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?\nJoey: That\u2019s right! \u2018Cause I\u2019m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don\u2019t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!\nOpening Credits\n, as Monica is getting everything ready.]\n"

But good to know where you\u2019re at!\nPhoebe: (entering) Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nPhoebe: Happy Thanksgiving!\nMonica: You too!\nPhoebe: Anything I can do to help?\nMonica: Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he\u2019s really into the game so I don\u2019t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)\nPhoebe: Sure!\nMonica: I\u2019m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.\nPhoebe: Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)\nMonica: No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We\u2019re not at a barn dance. You\u2019ve gotta\u2014you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how\u2019s the game?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nPhoebe: What?\nChandler: Yeah! I\u2019m just pretending to watch the game so I don\u2019t have to help out with stuff.\nPhoebe: I don\u2019t believe you! That is\u2026brilliant! And Monica has no idea?\nChandler: Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.\n(Monica enters and Chandler screams stuff at the TV.)\nMonica: Is your team winning hon?\nChandler: Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There\u2019s no Anderson.\nPhoebe: Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don\u2019t think I can help you after all, I didn\u2019t realize this game was on.\nMonica: Oh, I didn\u2019t know you liked football.\nPhoebe: Well normally I don\u2019t, but y\u2019know\u2026(looks at the TV)\u2026Green Bay is playing.\nMonica: You like Green Bay?\nPhoebe: Well it\u2019s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it\u2019s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }\n(Phoebe joins Chandler on the couch as there is a knock on the door which Monica answers.)\nMonica: Hey!\nWill: Hey!\n(Oh, I should point out that the live studio audience at this point goes absolutely wild. And I had absolutely no idea that this Will character was that popular! Maybe they should make him the seventh friend. Which would work out just fine since he\u2019s already married to one of them. Will is played by some guy named Brad Pitt, I guess he\u2019s some sort of actor.)\nWill: Happy Thanksgiving!\nMonica: Aww thanks! God Will I\u2019m so glad that you came! You look great! You must\u2019ve lost like\u2026\nWill: 150 pounds. Yeah, I\u2019m gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.\nMonica: A pie! (Will brought a pie.)\nWill: Oh right. All right, it\u2019s no fat, it\u2019s no sugar, it\u2019s no dairy\u2026it\u2019s no good. Throw it out.\nMonica: You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.\nWill: Hey.\nChandler: Oh hey. I\u2019d shake your hand but uh; I\u2019m really into the game. Plus, I think it\u2019d be better for my ego if we didn\u2019t stand right next to each other.\nMonica: This is Phoebe.\nPhoebe: (nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.\nMonica: (to Will) Wanna give me a hand?\nWill: Sure! Monica, I can\u2019t get over how great you look! You look stunning!\nMonica: Well you look incredible too! You\u2019re just\u2014you\u2019re so fit!\nChandler: I\u2019m watching the game, but I\u2019m not deaf!\nMonica: Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.\nWill: Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!\nMonica: Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)\nWill: Oh.\nMonica: Is there a problem?\nWill: Nope. Uh, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just uh, God I hated her.\nMonica: What?\nWill: Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I\u2019m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!\nChandler: (To Phoebe) Y\u2019know, it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve screamed something. Maybe we should.\nPhoebe: Oh okay.\nChandler: Oh come on!\nPhoebe: Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!\n(Joey enters eating potato chips.)\nMonica: Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you\u2019ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.\nJoey: Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin\u2019 chips is like stretching.\nMonica: All right.\nJoey: Don\u2019t worry, Tribbianis never get full.\nWill: I actually know what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.\nJoey: (To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?\nMonica: Will! From high school.\nJoey: Oh hey!\nMonica: (to Will) Joey.\nWill: Hello.\nRoss: (entering) Will!\nWill: Ross!\nRoss: Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?\nWill: It\u2019s good to see you man.\nRoss: Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?\nWill: I\u2019m a commodities broker.\nRoss: Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.\nWill: Yeah, it\u2019s not. But I\u2019m rich and thin.\nRoss: Oh! Man I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis\u2019 graduation party.\nWill: That was such a fun night!\nRoss: Yeah. It would\u2019ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.\nWill: Yeah.\nRoss: Yeah.\nWill: God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?\nRoss: (laughs) Yeah.\nWill: So what do you, what do you do now?\nRoss: So how long are you in town?\nRachel: (entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!\nMonica: Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)\nWill: (glaring at Rachel) Rachel Green.\nRoss: Aw\u2014oh, that\u2019s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?\nWill: Oh, I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!\nRoss: Will, high school was-was a long time ago.\nWill: Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.\nRachel: (sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?\nMonica: That\u2019s Will from high school!\nRachel: Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he\u2019s\u2026 Look at the way he\u2019s just staring at me. I think he\u2019s trying to mouth something to me, but I can\u2019t make it out. (Will mouths, \"I hate you.\")\nMonica: Okay, dinner\u2019s ready!\nChandler: Good game!\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nChandler: Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.\nMonica: Oh, so who won?\nPhoebe: (simultaneously) Green Bay.\nChandler: (simultaneously) Detroit.\nMonica: What?\nPhoebe: Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay\u2026Mermen.\n(They sit down at the table and Will goes to talk to Rachel.)\nRachel: Hi! Will, right?\nWill: Right.\nRachel: Hi! I\u2019m Rachel Green.\nWill: Oh I-I remember you.\nRachel: Really?! Aren\u2019t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis\u2019 graduation party?\nWill: You are unbelievable.\nRachel: Thank you!\nMonica: (breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don\u2019t you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)\n(Monica sets something on the table and removes the cover. It kinda looks like turkey.)\nJoey: That\u2019s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!\nMonica: (laughs) This is Chandler\u2019s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)\nJoey: (quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?\nMonica: About nineteen pounds.\nJoey: (To Rachel) It\u2019s like me when I was born.\nRachel: All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?\nWill: Oh, you\u2019d like that wouldn\u2019t ya?\nRachel: What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y\u2019know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!\nWill: (sneeze talks) Typical.\nRachel: I\u2019m sorry. What?\nWill: I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair flip.)\nJoey: (To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?\nRachel: Umm, I\u2019m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?\nWill: I don\u2019t know? Do I? Do I?\nPhoebe: I think you do.\nMonica: (To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.\nWill: A little mean? You made my life miserable!\nRachel: I\u2019m-I\u2019m\u2014I had no idea. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2026\nWill: Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!\nMonica: Oh Will. But you-you\u2019ve worked so hard\u2026\nWill: Yams!!!!\nMonica: Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.)\nRachel: Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I\u2019m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school\u2026\nWill: Oh, it wasn\u2019t just me. We had a club!\nRachel: You had a club?!\nWill: That\u2019s right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!\nRachel: Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?\nWill: Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)\nRoss: No need to point, she knows who Ross is.\nCommercial Break\n"

We had a pact!\nRoss: That was in high school! It\u2019s not like it was binding forever.\nWill: Then why did it have the word eternity in it?\nRachel: Okay Monica, did you know about this?!\nMonica: I swear I didn\u2019t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?\nRoss and Will: Yeah.\nMonica: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.\nRoss: Look Rach I-I\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2026I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined\u2026\nWill: Co-founded!\nRoss: \u2026co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn\u2019t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.\nWill: Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.\nRachel: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?\nWill: Well, we did a little more than that.\nRoss: No-no! No-no. No-no.\nPhoebe: What?! What else did you do?\nWill: We started a rumor.\nRachel: What rumor?\nPhoebe: Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!\nRachel: Ross!\nRoss: It was no big deal. We-we\u2026said that the rumor was\u2026that umm\u2026you had both\u2026male and female reproductive parts.\nRachel: What?!\nWill: That\u2019s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.\nRachel: (shocked) Oh my God!\nMonica: You started that?!\nRachel: What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)\nMonica: Everyone at our school heard it!\nChandler: Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!\nRachel: Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn\u2019t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)\nRoss: Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one\u2019s not really our fault.\nRachel: Monica, how come you never told me this?!\nMonica: I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.\n(Joey is now looking at Rachel, and since Rachel\u2019s standing and he\u2019s sitting down and he\u2019s not looking at her face\u2026 You get the picture.)\nRachel: Joey stop staring! There\u2019s nothing there! It\u2019s not true!\nJoey: I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna need proof.\nRachel: Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)\n[Time Lapse, dinner has ended for everyone except Joey who looks like to have finished the turkey, until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side.]\nJoey: You are my Everest.\nMonica: Joey, you don\u2019t have to finish that.\nJoey: Oh yes I do. Otherwise what\u2019s next? Today I\u2019m just a guy who can\u2019t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I\u2019m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just\u2026I just\u2014I gotta change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)\nRachel: (entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, \"Dear Rach, you\u2019re such a good person.\" Not girl! Person!\nRoss: Rach, I think you\u2019re reading a little too much into it.\nRachel: (reading what he wrote again) \"Dear Rach, you\u2019re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie.\" (Will laughs.)\nRoss: Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn\u2019t true?!\nRachel: Yes!\nWill: Could you also tell them I\u2019m skinny now?\nMonica: Oh! Me too!\nRoss: Well look-look I\u2019m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!\nRachel: I don\u2019t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y\u2019know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.\nMonica: That\u2019s not totally true.\nRachel: What?\nRoss: What?\nMonica: Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.\nRoss: (shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!\nMonica: It\u2019s true?!!\nRoss: No.\nRachel: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!\n(Ross is at a loss for words.)\nWill: Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.\nChandler: I\u2019m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?\nRoss: Hey! She didn\u2019t look 50!\nChandler: Did she look 16?\nRachel: Ohh, there\u2019s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.\nPhoebe: Oh! (They all look.) Wow!\nRoss: She didn\u2019t photograph well!\nChandler: Well, she probably wasn\u2019t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!\nPhoebe: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?\nRoss: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace\u2026\nMonica: Didn\u2019t she walk with a cane?\nRoss: Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can\u2019t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y\u2019know what? (To Will) I\u2019m back in the club!\nWill: Yeah! (They high-five.)\nPhoebe: I wanna join!\nRachel: Wh\u2014Phoebe!!\nPhoebe: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn\u2019t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.\nRachel: All right, y\u2019know\u2014Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)\nMonica: All right, listen you\u2019re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!\nRachel: Wow\u2026\nMonica: And Ross, if it weren\u2019t for Rachel\u2019s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!\nRoss: As a romancer of the elderly.\nMonica: Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.\nRoss: The eyes\u2026did still sparkle.\nMonica: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you\u2019ve been through so much since then. And right now you\u2019ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can\u2019t you just let this go?\nRachel: She\u2019s right.\nRoss: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.\nWill: Hold on! You got her pregnant?\nRoss: Yeah.\nWill: Are ya getting married?\nRoss: Nope.\nWill: So you knocked her up but you\u2019re not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wants another high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?\nPhoebe: Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It\u2019s exactly how I\u2019d imagined it would be.\nJoey: (entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right where\u2019s that turkey!\nPhoebe: Joey!
