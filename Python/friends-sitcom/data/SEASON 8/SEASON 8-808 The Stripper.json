I just need you there for support. I haven\u2019t told him I\u2019m pregnant yet.\nPhoebe: Oh. Why not?\nRachel: \u2018Cause I know he\u2019s gonna flip out and I hate it when he\u2019s angry.\nPhoebe: Oh Rachel, this is all so \u2018Papa don\u2019t preach.\u2019\nRachel: What Phoebe? Wait!

I mean wh\u2014Did you let her smoke in here?\nChandler: Her ass print is still on your grandmother\u2019s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?\nMonica: Y\u2019know what? I\u2019m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you\u2019re gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)\nChandler: Monica! Wait!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: (puts on his crown) Carry on.\n(She does so by taking off her jacket seductively, only she has trouble getting one hand out and slams the jacket on the chair angrily to remove it.)\nMonica: Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I\u2019ll take them off. (Goes to do so.)\nChandler: Could you not narrate?\nMonica: Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)\nClosing Credits\n"
