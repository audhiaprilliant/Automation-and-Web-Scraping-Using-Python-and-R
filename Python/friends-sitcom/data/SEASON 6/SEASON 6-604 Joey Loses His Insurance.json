Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)\nA Student: What\u2019s happening to your accent?\nRoss: (British) Come again? What\u2019s-what\u2019s this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, I\u2019m-I\u2019m not English. I\u2019m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I\u2019m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I\u2019m-I\u2019m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression\u2026\n(At this moment Rachel bursts through the door. Needless to say, she\u2019s not in the best of moods having just found out Ross\u2019s dirty little secret.)\nRachel: Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!\nRoss: (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!\nEnding Credits\n Because he\u2019s made a miraculous recovery from his hernia and wants to take advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since he\u2019s re-established his health insurance.]\n"
