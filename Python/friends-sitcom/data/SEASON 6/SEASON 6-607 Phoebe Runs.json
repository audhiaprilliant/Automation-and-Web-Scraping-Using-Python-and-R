Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.\nRoss: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.\nChandler: All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?\nJoey: Oh God, yeah.\nChandler: Now imagine you live at the supermarket.\nJoey: (happily) Okay!\nChandler: No-no\nJoey: Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!\nMonica: Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.\nJoey: Well, that's gonna be tough Mon.
