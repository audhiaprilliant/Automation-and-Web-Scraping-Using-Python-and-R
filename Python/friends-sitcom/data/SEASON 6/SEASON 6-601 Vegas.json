But David was a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For they\u2019re all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette, and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman Arquette.

And, how do I tell her without crushing her?\nJoey: Oh! Tell her she\u2019s not marriage material.\nChandler: What?!\nJoey: Girls say it to me all the time!

That\u2019s ridiculous!\n(They turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get married.)\nRoss: We-we-we\u2014I remember being in a chapel.\nRachel: Oh my God.\nRoss: I\u2014They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!\nRachel: No!\nJoey: They let you get married when you\u2019re drunk!

I\u2019m on vacation!\nMonica: What are you guys gonna do?\nRachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)\nChandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one\u2019s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one\u2019s free.\nRoss: Laugh it up, but the joke\u2019s on you. Because we don\u2019t need to get divorced, okay? We we\u2019re just gonna get an annulment.\nJoey: An annulment? Ross! I don\u2019t think surgery\u2019s the answer here.\nPhoebe: Oh-oh, that\u2019s your thing.\nRoss: What?\nPhoebe: You\u2019re thing. You\u2019re thing. Y\u2019know? You\u2019re the guy who gets divorced.\nAll: Oh yeah!\nRoss: No-no, that\u2019s-that\u2019s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!\nPhoebe: Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you\u2019re probably gonna marry it! Then it won\u2019t work out and you\u2019re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I\u2019m so drunk.\n"

I guess.\nMonica: Wait a minute. That wasn\u2019t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.\nChandler: That\u2019s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!\nMonica: I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?\nChandler: Yeah. (They go pack.) We\u2019re doing the right thing, right?\nMonica: Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.)
