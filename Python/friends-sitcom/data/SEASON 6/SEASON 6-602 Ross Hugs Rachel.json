But when I got to my lawyer\u2019s office all I could hear was, \"Three divorces. Three divorces!\" Look, I just don\u2019t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.\nPhoebe: Don\u2019t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y\u2019know? Mine\u2019s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.\nRoss: Look, all I know is I-I can\u2019t have another failed marriage!\nPhoebe: So okay what? You\u2019re gonna be married to a girl who doesn\u2019t even know about it?!\u2014Op, woman! Sorry.\nRoss: Well, okay so, I don\u2019t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don\u2019t say anything to Rachel, please?\nPhoebe: Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!\n(Rachel\u2019s cab backs up.)\nRachel: (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!\nPhoebe: Hey Rach!\nRachel: What was that?!\nPhoebe: Sorry, mix up.
