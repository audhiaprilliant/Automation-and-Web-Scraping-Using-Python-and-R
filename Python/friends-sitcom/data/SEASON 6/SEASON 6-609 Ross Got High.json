Hehheh.\n[Chandler throws his coat on the couch]\nMonica: (not amused by Chandler\u2019s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.\nChandler: Oh! That\u2019s great, they haven\u2019t seen the place since I moved in!\n[Monica goes to fiddle with something on the table.]\nMonica: Yeah, and y\u2019know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.\n[Monica goes to the stove.]\nChandler: (shocked at the news) Why can\u2019t I tell them that we live together?\nMonica: Because they don\u2019t know we\u2019re dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)\nChandler: Why haven\u2019t you told them?!\nMonica: Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn\u2019t.\nChandler: Why haven\u2019t you told them?! Wouldn\u2019t they be happy?!\nMonica: (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I\u2019ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)\nChandler: Why wouldn\u2019t they be happy?\nMonica: Well, um, because mainly, um, they don\u2019t like you. I\u2019m sorry.\nChandler: What? What? Why?!\nMonica: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you\u2019re really sarcastic, or that, y\u2019know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.\nChandler: Is this why they don\u2019t like me or why you don\u2019t like me?\nMonica: Look, I know that I should\u2019ve told them. I know I shouldn\u2019t care what they think. I\u2019m sorry.\nChandler: Y\u2019know, it\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we\u2019ll tell \u2018em.\nMonica: You really think that\u2019ll work?\nChandler: Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn\u2019t I?\nMonica: (hugging Chandler) I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get my parents that drunk!\nOpening Credits\n"

Yeah, why? What\u2019s up?\nJanine: Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.\nRoss: For real?\nJanine: No, but you should go to Chandler\u2019s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we\u2019ll probably just end up drinking all day.\nJoey: Ye-ye, we go to yours!\nRoss: Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it\u2019s my sister. But, uh, uh y\u2019know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women.

I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.\nRachel: Really?!\nPhoebe: Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it\u2019s making me look at him totally differently. Y\u2019know, I mean he used to be just, y\u2019know \u201cJack Geller Monica and Ross\u2019s dad\u201d and now he\u2019s he\u2019s \u201cJack Geller, dream hunk.\"\n[We see a shot of Jack stuffing his face with food.

Tell me, what does your father do?\n[Chandler and Monica exchange worried looks.]\nChandler: (worried) He\u2019s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.\n[Rachel is in the kitchen fiddling with her English truffle. Joey and Ross, anxious to leave and go to Janine\u2019s party, are egging her on to hurry up.]\nJoey: Rach, you\u2019re killin\u2019 us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!\nRachel: (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn\u2019t it beautiful?\nRoss: Yeah, yeah, what is it?\nRachel: It\u2019s a truffle. It\u2019s got all of these layers. First there\u2019s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something\u2019s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!\n[Joey and Ross make confused faces.]\nRoss: W-What was the one right before bananas?\nRachel: The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y\u2019know, I thought \u201cwell, there\u2019s mincemeat pie,\u201d I mean that\u2019s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y\u2019know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?\nJoey: Y-sure!\nRachel: (teasingly) And while I\u2019m gone don\u2019t you boys sneak a taste.\nJoey and Ross: (faking dissapointment) Okay.\n[Rachel leaves]\nRoss: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!\n[Ross goes to look in the magazine Rachel got her recipe from.]\nJoey: I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?\n[Ross looks up as if saying that Joey was weird. He begins flipping through the pages, only to find that they are sticky. So one page is overlapping another, making two recipes look like one.]\nRoss: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!\nJoey: (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!\nRoss: Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd\u2019s Pie!\nJoey: (sad) Oh man! Now she\u2019s gonna start all over! We\u2019re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!\nRoss: No, no, we will. We just won\u2019t tell her she messed up.\nJoey: Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?\nRoss: Yeah, it\u2019ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!\nJoey: (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...\n[Rachel enters]\nRachel: Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!\nJoey: Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?\nRachel: No!\nJoey: (frustrated) Still not hot enough!\n[Joey leaves]\n[Phoebe walks over to talk to Rachel.]\nPhoebe: Rachel?\nRachel: Yeah?\nPhoebe: Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn\u2019t give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.\n[We see a shot of Jack drinking condensed milk on the couch.]\n[Ross and Judy enter the living room.

I just bought it.\nChandler: Oh, yes. Well it\u2019s very beautiful. It\u2019s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.

Gooooood.\n[Rachel and Chandler re-emerge from the balcony.]\nRachel: ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?\n[Chandler makes a fake \"I know I couldn\u2019t believe it either\" gesture.]\nChandler: (lying) Yes, but if it\u2019s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.\n[Phoebe comes back from Rachel\u2019s old room.]\nPhoebe: Rachel, come here.

So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.\nRachel: (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!\nPhoebe: Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool!

Let\u2019s go.\nRoss: Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.\nMonica: Alright, you know what? That\u2019s it. You\u2019ve had your chance.\nRoss: Wha-what?\nMonica: (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!\nMr. and Mrs. Geller: What?!\nRoss: (in a 5 year old\u2019s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?\nMr. and Mrs. Geller: Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)\nRoss: Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I\u2019m sorry.\nMrs. Geller: It was you?\nMonica: And Dad, y\u2019know that mailman that you got fired? He didn\u2019t steal your Playboys! Ross did!\n[The Gellers stare at Ross.
