Why don\u2019t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?\nPhoebe: Ooh, Joey, that\u2019s actually a really good idea!\nJoey: And of course, crotchless panties.\nChandler: Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can\u2019t do that we promised we\u2019d make each other gifts this year.\nRachel: Aw, I love that.\nPhoebe: You guys!\nJoey: You can\u2019t make crotchless panties?

I\u2019m just gonna over\u2026 (She starts to get up.)\nPhoebe: (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!\n(Ross appears at the window behind them crouched behind a garbage can and ready to spring his attack on who he thinks are Phoebe and Rachel. The camera cuts to the exterior view and Phoebe and Rachel call the shots from inside.)\nPhoebe: Why is Ross doing that?\nRoss: DANGER!!!!\nRachel: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!\nPhoebe: We should help him!\nRachel: I\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t think they need any help.\n(Ross starts to scream and run away. He stops in front of the window of Central Perk to check the pursuit and notices Phoebe and Rachel inside looking at him. He mouths, \"What?\" Then realizes that the women he attacked are closing in so he screams and runs away.)\nEnd\n"
