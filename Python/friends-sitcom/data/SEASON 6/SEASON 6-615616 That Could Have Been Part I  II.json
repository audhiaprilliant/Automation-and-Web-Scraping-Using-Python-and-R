Barry and Mindy.\nJoey: Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who\u2019s Barry and Mindy?\nRachel: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.\nJoey: Ohh-oh, wasn\u2019t he cheating on you with her?\nRachel: Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.\nMonica: Why did they get divorced?\nRachel: Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn\u2019t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?\nRoss: I know what you mean, I\u2019ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I\u2019d never gotten divorced.\nPhoebe: Which time?\nRoss: The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn\u2019t realized she was a lesbian.\nJoey: (starts to imagine it) I can\u2019t. I keep seeing it the good way.\nRoss: I\u2019d bet I\u2019d still be doing my kara-tay. (That\u2019s karate, he\u2019s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y\u2019know, not doing anything else physical.\nChandler: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.\nMonica: And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn\u2019t be dating me, that\u2019s for sure.\nChandler: Sure I would!\nAll: (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!\nChandler: What, you guys really think that I\u2019m that shallow?\nRoss: No, I just think Monica was that fat.\nJoey: Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there\u2019s Carol again!\nChandler: What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I\u2019d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job\u2019s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don\u2019t have to wear a tie.\nPhoebe: What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?\nRoss: What?!\nRachel: Merrill Lynch?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.\nRachel: Well why didn\u2019t you take the job?\nPhoebe: Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y\u2019know that if I\u2019d work with stocks, I\u2019d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.\nRoss: Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we\u2019d still hang out?\nOpening Credits\n{Transcriber\u2019s note: This is where the opening credits are, but they\u2019re not the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel\u2019s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they\u2019re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn\u2019t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.}\n"

I played you one of my songs, y\u2019know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.\nRachel: Oh yeah. Right. So now, are\u2014do you, do you still do music?\nRoss: Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!

Are you okay?\nRachel: Me? I\u2019m great! I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m sooo good!! But, you know who\u2019s not great?! Men! You\u2019re a man right Ross?!\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Sit down!\nRoss: Okay. (He does so.)\nRachel: Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we\u2019re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor\u2019s dog walker?!\nRoss: We\u2019re sorry.\nRachel: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?\nRoss: Didn\u2019t you spend last night at Joey\u2019s?\nRachel: Aw what are you?! A detective?\nRoss: Look I-I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.\nRachel: Oh. (Doesn\u2019t believe it.)\nRoss: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!\nRachel: Who are these men?\nRoss: Men. I guy I know.\nRachel: Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.\nRoss: She is not\u2026 (Realizes) She\u2019s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can\u2019t believe this.\nRachel: Good day for married people huh?\nRoss: I\u2019m sorry your husband cheated on you.\nRachel: I\u2019m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren\u2019t that great either.\nRoss: Try telling my wife that.\n"
