She started kissing me and-and I didn\u2019t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn\u2019t thinking\u2026\nRachel: Yeah that\u2019s right you weren\u2019t thinking! Y\u2019know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)\nRoss: Oh wait\u2014hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.\nRachel: Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister\u2019s mouth long enough to tell me that.\nRoss: Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!\nRachel: What?!\nRoss: No, I mean, look I don\u2019t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don\u2019t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.\nRachel: Wow. I, I don\u2019t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)\nRoss: You\u2019re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)\n(Chandler starts crying.)\nMonica: Oh my God! Are-are you crying?\nChandler: (crying hysterically) I just don\u2019t see why those two can\u2019t work things out!\nEnding Credits\n"
