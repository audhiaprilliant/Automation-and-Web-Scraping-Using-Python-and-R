Because I\u2019m a teacher and she\u2019s a student.\nChandler: Oh, is that against the rules?\nRoss: No, but it is frowned upon.\nChandler: I see.\nRoss: Besides, there\u2019s a big age difference.\nJoey: Oh, well think of it like this, when you\u2019re 90\u2026\nRoss: I know when I\u2019m 90 she\u2019ll be like 80 and it won\u2019t seem like such a big difference.\nJoey: No that\u2019s not what I was going to say at all.

I don\u2019t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!\nPhoebe: No but at Monica\u2019s you can eat cookies over the sink!\nRachel: I know.
