I mean, this isn\u2019t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.\nRichard: You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)\nChandler: Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?\nRichard: No I don\u2019t have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don\u2019t let her go. Trust me.\nChandler: Y\u2019know Richard\u2026you are a good guy.\nRichard: I know. (Pause) I hate that!\n(Chandler gets up and runs out, but as soon as the door closes behind him he opens it, runs back in, picks up his ring Richard is holding up for him, and runs back out.)\n"

She had a bag and she left.\nChandler: What are you talking about?\nJoey: She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.\nChandler: Well why didn\u2019t you stop her?! Why didn\u2019t you just tell her it was a plan?!\nJoey: I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn\u2019t believe me.\nChandler: Well where\u2026 Where did she go?\nJoey: To her parent\u2019s I think and she said you shouldn\u2019t call her.

Oh God, I thought\u2026 (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you\u2019ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?\nMonica: Yes.\n(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as an engaged couple.)\nMonica: I knew you were likely to take a wife!\n(They hug again.)\nJoey: (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We\u2019re dying out here!\nMonica: Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We\u2019re engaged!!!\n(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)\nRachel: Ohhh, this is the least jealous I\u2019ve ever been!\nPhoebe: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn\u2019t here!\nMonica: Oh\u2026\nRachel: Oh hell, he\u2019s done this three times! He knows what its about!\nJoey: Yeah!\n(They all hug again.)\nEnding Credits\n"
