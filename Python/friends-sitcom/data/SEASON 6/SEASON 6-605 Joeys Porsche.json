(Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. It\u2019s times like these I\u2019m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn\u2019t been invented.)

We\u2019ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.\nMonica: What do you mean?\nChandler: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone.

And y\u2019know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around\u2026 (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)\nPhoebe: That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.\nChandler: Okay, I\u2019m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.\n[Time lapse, they have set up a little assembly line for diaper changes.

People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.\nChandler: What equity investments?\nJoey: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they\u2019re gonna start to think that I don\u2019t own it. So I figured I\u2019ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?\nMonica: Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.\nChandler: You don\u2019t even have a car!\nMonica: I know.

I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn\u2019t be a secret, and we wouldn\u2019t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)\nRoss: Did I, did I even treat?\nRachel: No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.\nRoss: That may be the most depressing thing I\u2019ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer\u2019s office.\nRachel: Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.\nRoss: Eh, no problem.\n(They hug.)\nRachel: I\u2019m gonna need a copy of those.\nRoss: Totally. (Exits.)\nEnding Credits\n"

It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)\nEnd\n"
