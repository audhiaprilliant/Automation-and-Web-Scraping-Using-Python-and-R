Is this the spoiled one or that\u2019s bitter?\nJill: (To Rachel) Daddy cut me off.\nPhoebe: Never mind, I got it.\nJill: And y\u2019know what I said to him? \"I\u2019m gonna hire a lawyer and I\u2019m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I\u2019m gonna cut you off!\"\nRachel: Wow! What did he say?\nJill: That he wouldn\u2019t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he\u2019s actually proud off.\nRachel: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad\u2019s proud of me! My dad\u2019s proud of me.\nMonica: Rach? (Points to Jill.)\nRachel: Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?\nJill: Okay, I bought a boat.\nMonica: You bought a boat?\nJill: Yeah but it wasn\u2019t for me, it was for a friend.\nChandler: Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)\nRachel: Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could\u2019ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I\u2019m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you\u2019re gonna do. You\u2019re gonna get a job, you\u2019re gonna get an apartment, and then I\u2019ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?\nPhoebe: Of course, yeah!\nJill: Oh, that\u2019s so great! Okay, I\u2019m really gonna do this!

I invented that!\nJill: Right! But, I am sorry.\nRachel: All right, it\u2019s okay. One little setback is okay, just don\u2019t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I\u2019m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh, and the uh pants. Y\u2019know what, I\u2019m just gonna take it all away, \u2018cause that way you\u2019ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I\u2019m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jill\u2019s stuff.)\nJill: She took all my stuff.\nRoss: Yeah.
