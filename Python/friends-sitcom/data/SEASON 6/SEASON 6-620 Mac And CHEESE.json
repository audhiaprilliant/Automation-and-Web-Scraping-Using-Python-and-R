I\u2019m gonna hug ya!\nJoey: You hug me!\nChandler: All right!\n[What follows is the final set of flashbacks that feature a whole lot of lovin\u2019 between Chandler and Joey. There\u2019s no words, just hugs and even the kiss from The One With The Monkey. All of this is set to the song, You\u2019ve Really Got a Hold on Me!]\n[Cut back to the present, they are still in each other\u2019s embrace.]\nJoey: Hey, do we do this too much?\nChandler: I think so.
