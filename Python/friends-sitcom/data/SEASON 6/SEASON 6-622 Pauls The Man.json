No! It\u2019s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!\nChandler: I\u2019ll give up my ticket.\nJoey: Me too.\nPhoebe: Okay that\u2019s so generous!\nChandler: And I think Ross is generous too.\nPhoebe: Great! Okay then it\u2019s just us girls!\nMonica and Rachel: (less than enthused) Great.\nPhoebe: Yeah.\nRachel: So what-what is the exhibit.\nPhoebe: It\u2019s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.\nJoey: Oh man! (Hits Chandler)\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nRachel: Hi!\nChandler: Hey!\nJoey: Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!\nRoss: Thanks?

What?\nMonica: Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?\nRoss: No, no, that\u2019s funny. But maybe it\u2019s time to move on, let it go, y\u2019know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth\u2019s father, so ah, he\u2019s much older than she is. Looks like I\u2019m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?\nRachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.\nRoss: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.\n(And walks up right behind Ross, and standard sitcom joke 2B follows with the person being insulted standing right behind the person doing the insulting while the rest of the people become frightened and try to warn the insulter about the insultee\u2019s presence.)\nChandler: Ross.\nRoss: Oh, come on you guys; that\u2019s funny!

Paul then pulls Ross aside to have a little chat with him and tells the rest of the group that he\u2019ll just be one second.)\nPaul: Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I\u2019ve decided to accept the fact that you\u2019re going out with her.\nRoss: Really? That okay, that\u2019s great.\nPaul: Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I\u2019m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t want you seeing my daughter anymore.\nRoss: All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.\nPaul: Yes it does.\nRoss: But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really anything you can do about it.\nPaul: I\u2019ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.\nRoss: Ohh!
