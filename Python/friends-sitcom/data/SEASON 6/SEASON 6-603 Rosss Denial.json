Denise!\nJoey: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?\nChandler: Pheebs, I don\u2019t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?\nPhoebe: Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time!

She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn\u2019t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.\nPhoebe: What do you mean, comforted her?\nRoss: It\u2019s nothing, I just gave her a hug.\nPhoebe: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!\nRoss: It\u2019s also a sign of friendship.\nPhoebe: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.

What if I did?\nPhoebe: Ninety percent of a women\u2019s pheromones come out the top of her head! That\u2019s why, that\u2019s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!

It\u2019s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she\u2019s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh\u2026coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn\u2019t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!\nPhoebe: (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel\u2019s not in the same place you are.\nRoss: (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!\nPhoebe: Okay, I didn\u2019t understand that, but y\u2019know, maybe that\u2019s \u2018cause you were speaking the secret language of love!\n(She goes for his magazine and he grabs it away before she reaches it.
