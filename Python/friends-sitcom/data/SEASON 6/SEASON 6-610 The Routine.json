Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life\u2019s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.\nRachel: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.\n(Joey enters)\nJoey: Hey you guys.\nChandler: Hey Joe what\u2019s up?\nJoey: I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y\u2019know, everywhere I look she\u2019s like\u2026 (He imitates her stretching)\nChandler: I can see why that\u2019s hard to resist.\nJoey: I like her so much!\nMonica: Aw, I\u2019m sorry sweetie that she doesn\u2019t feel the same way.\nJoey: I know. And she\u2019s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.\nChandler: You are aware that she\u2019s not a monkey, right?\nRoss: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she\u2019s like OLD NEWS!\n(Janine enters)\nJanine: Hey guys!\nRoss: Hi Janine!\nJanine: I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year\u2019s Eve. It\u2019s called some sort of Dick\u2019n Rock\u2019n Dickie Eve.\nMonica: Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rocking Eve?\nJanine: Yeah, that\u2019s what I said.\nMonica: Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!\nChandler: Ah, you\u2019re still just a little fat girl inside aren\u2019t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)\nJanine: Well I\u2019m gonna be on it this year. I\u2019m gonna be one of the party people.\nRoss: You\u2019re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!\nJanine: Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my dance partner?\nJoey: Totally! I would love to spend New Year\u2019s with you.\nJanine: Well actually they\u2019re taping tomorrow. I don\u2019t really understand why.\nRoss: Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.\nJanine: Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?\nRoss: Are you serious?\nMonica: We are there!\n(Rachel laughs)\nChandler: What, what are you laughing at?\nRachel: Well, I used to date him, but you\u2019re still going out with her!\n(Gunther brings Janine a coffee)\nJanine: Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!\n(Janine leaves)\nAll: Bye!\nRoss: Bye Janine!\nJoey: Did she just ask me out on a date?\nChandler: I don\u2019t think so.\nMonica: What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!\nRachel: Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think that was a romantic thing.\nJoey: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We\u2019re going to a New Year\u2019s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y\u2019know? But if she says \u2018Dude, what the hell are you doing?\u2019 I can say \u2018It wasn\u2019t me, it was New Years!\u2019\nRachel: Well, that\u2019s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.\nRoss: It was a dry day.\nMonica: We are going to Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rocking Eve!\nRoss: Oh my God!\nMonica: Oh my God!\nChandler: (To Rachel) Oh my God!\n"
