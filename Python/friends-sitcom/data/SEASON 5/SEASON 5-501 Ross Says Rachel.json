But, when we\u2019re back home, we don\u2019t do it.\nMonica: Only here.\nChandler: Y\u2019know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs\u2026\nMonica: I\u2019ll meet you there in two minutes.\nChandler: Okay!\n(He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, Monica is about to follow him but is intercepted by Rachel.)\nRachel: Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.\nMonica: (impatiently) Now?\nRachel: Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can\u2019t pretend that didn\u2019t happen can I?\nMonica: Oh, I-I don\u2019t know.\nRachel: Monica, what should I do?\nMonica: Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)\nRachel: What?\nMonica: Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)\nRachel: Whoa, wait, listen, I think I\u2019m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.\nMonica: Wait. Rachel, no, he\u2019s married. Married! If you don\u2019t realize that, I can\u2019t help you.\nRachel: Okay, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. You can\u2019t help me.\n(Cut to Mr. and Mrs. Geller.)\nMrs. Geller: Jack, is it all our fault?

(He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he\u2019s eating it with his hands.)\n(Cut to Monica and Chandler, Monica is running up to him.)\nMonica: Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?\nChandler: Forget it, that\u2019s off.\nMonica: Why?!\nMr. Waltham: (drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes\u2026\n(Joey walks up to them.)\nMonica: Joey, what are you doing?

I mean, so you said my name! Y\u2019know you just said it \u2018cause you saw me there, if you\u2019d have seen a circus freak, you would\u2019ve said, \"I take thee circus freak.\" Y\u2019know, it didn\u2019t mean anything, it\u2019s just a mistake. It didn\u2019t mean anything. Right?\nRoss: No! No! Of course it didn\u2019t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y\u2019know, because-because it was you\u2026\nRachel: Right\u2026\nRoss: But it absolutely didn\u2019t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn\u2019t!! It didn\u2019t!!\nJoey: (approaching) Ross, hey, the band\u2019s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so\u2026\nRoss: (sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band\u2019s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says\u2014I don\u2019t care about the stupid band!!\nJoey: You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)\nRoss: Look, I\u2019m sorry.\nJoey: Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?\nRachel: (laughs) Y\u2019know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.\nRoss: Oh, right!\nRachel: Get the hell out of there, y\u2019know?\n(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run over to the bathroom.)\nRoss: (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I\u2019m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)\nRachel: Well, look at that, same thing.\n"
