Really?\nJoey: Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?\nRoss: That's a good point.\nJoey: Yeah.\nRoss: Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.\nJoey: Okay, great!\nRoss: All right.\nJoey: Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!\nPhoebe: It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?\nJoey: Rach! Rach!

Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.\nPhoebe: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.\nMonica: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.\nRoss: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.\nChandler: I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the \"new thing you do that day!\" (Ross looks at him.)

How come?\nJoey: Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.\nPhoebe: Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.\nJoey: Really? Who-who have you taught?\nPhoebe: Well, I taught me and I love me.\nJoey: Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!\nRachel: Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.\nMonica: Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.\nRachel: I don't gossip!\n(They all laugh.)\nRachel: Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?\nMonica: Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.\nRachel: What? They were like this!\n(She puts her hands over her breasts and indicates that the coworkers boob job resulted in one pointing up and one pointing down with her hands by pointing up with one hand and down with the other.)\n"

(Points to the guitar.)\nJoey: Umm, okay.\nPhoebe: Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw.

I can't pick out the rest of it.)\nRoss: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, \"Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.\"\n(No one says anything.)\nChandler: Oh come on!!

In other words, it sounds like he farted. She has a look of horrific wonderment, wondering \"Did he just fart?\")\nRoss: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?\nElizabeth: No, go ahead.\nRoss: Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)\n[Cut to Elizabeth Hornswoggle's bathroom, Ross frantically pulls his shirt out and drops his pants. He exhales in sheer ecstasy as the coolness of the bathroom envelops his legs. He sits on the cast iron bathtub, again gasping in pleasure. He next grabs a magazine and starts to blow air on his exposed legs, but that doesn't work the way he wants it to. So he throws the magazine down, looks around for another idea, and finds one. He jumps up and hops to the sink. He turns on the water and starts to splash some on his legs, cooling them further.]\nRoss: (in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nElizabeth: (yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!\nRoss: 'Kay!\n(He goes to pull up his pants, but can't seem to get them past his knees.
