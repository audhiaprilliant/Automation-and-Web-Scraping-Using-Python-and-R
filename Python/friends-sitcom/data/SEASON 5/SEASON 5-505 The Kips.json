What are you doing?\nJoey: (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.\nMonica: Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles\u2026\nPhoebe: Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)\nChandler: Condoms?\nJoey: You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.\nChandler: And condoms are the way to do that?\n[Cut to the living room.]\nRoss: Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily\u2026\nRachel: (interrupting) Oh my God!
