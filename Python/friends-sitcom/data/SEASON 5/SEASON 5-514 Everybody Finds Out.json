No. You?\nPhoebe: No, I want this to happen.\nChandler: So do I.\n(They click their glasses and take a sip.

Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.)\nPhoebe: Ooh.\nChandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\nPhoebe: Here it comes. Our first kiss.\n(They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.)\nChandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\nPhoebe: And why not?!\nChandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!\nPhoebe: You're-you're what?!\n(Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.)\nChandler: Love her!
