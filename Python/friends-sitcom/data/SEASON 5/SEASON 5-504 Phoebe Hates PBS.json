Talk about selfish!\nPhoebe: What-what are you talking about?!\nJoey: Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?\nPhoebe: Yeah. So?\nJoey: It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.\nPhoebe: Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.\nJoey: Well, may I ask for one example?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's\u2026 Y'know there's\u2014no you may not!\n(They are standing on either side of Chandler as they discuss the point.
