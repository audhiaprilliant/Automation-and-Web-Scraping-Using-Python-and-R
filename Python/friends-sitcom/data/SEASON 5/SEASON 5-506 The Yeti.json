A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.\n(She puts her leg up on the chair and removes this huge knife from her boot to open the box with. The guys are shocked at the knife's existence.)\nPhoebe: Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)\nJoey: Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?\nPhoebe: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!\nChandler: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.

Everybody else does.\nGunther: You can't.\nMonica: What is that?\nRoss: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.\nMonica: (looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.\nRoss: Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's\u2014Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.\nMonica: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.\nRoss: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.\nGunther: I'll take it all.\nJoey: Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?\nRoss: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.\nChandler: Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?\nRoss: After what I did? Can you blame her?\nPhoebe: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.\n(Ross suddenly gets up and heads for the bathroom.)\nJoey: (after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?\nMonica: Now calm down Joey.\nJoey: No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!\nPhoebe: Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.\nChandler: Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence\u2026\nMonica: Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?\nJoey: No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.\n"
