No chicken, bye-bye then.\nJoey: Okay.\n(Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)\nJoey: You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?\nChandler: For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!\nJoey: All right!\n(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)\nChandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.\nMonica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.\nChandler: Hey Joe!\n(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)\nChandler: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in\npain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.\n(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)\nOpening Credits\n"

Okay, I was coming over here and this driver\u2026\nJoey: (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)\nPhoebe: What?\nJoey: Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.\nPhoebe: Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway\u2026\nMonica: Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?\nChandler: Uh, The Wheatsheaf.\nJoey: Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh\u2026\nMonica: Bodington's!\nAll: Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)\nChandler: Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.\nPhoebe: Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat\u2014I don't want to talk about it.\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nAll: Hey!\nJoey: Hey, Ross, Bodington's!\nRoss: Yeah! (They high-five.)\nJoey: That was good beer.\nRoss: Ohh\u2026\nJoey: Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.\nRoss: Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.\nJoey: Later! (Exits.)\nRoss: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?\nMonica: Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.\nRoss: Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?\nMonica: No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.\nRoss: Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know\u2014Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?\nPhoebe: So you still hadn't heard from Emily?\nRoss: No, not since I lost her at the airport.\nChandler: I can't believe she can out run you man!\nRoss: HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!\nRachel: (entering) Hi!\nAll: Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)\nRoss: Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.\nRachel: Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.\nRoss: That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.\nRachel: Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)\nRoss: So, what? That's it?\nRachel: Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.\nRoss: Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)\nRachel: Oh no, you're the best.\nRoss: (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.\nChandler: Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.\n(Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season. Read about it here.)\nMonica: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!\nRachel: What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, \"Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?\" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.\nChandler: Oh that's not true.\nRachel: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.\nPhoebe: London is stupid! Stupid!\nRachel: Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.\nPhoebe: Oh\u2026 No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.\nMonica: I'll do it!\nRachel: That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.\nChandler: Okay, I gotta go to work.\n(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in amazement. After the kiss ends, Chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides to do something rather rash.)\nChandler: And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.\n(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is shocked.)\nChandler: Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)\n"

I know, I know that wasn't about me.\nJoey: (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.\nMonica: If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.\nRachel: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda\u2026\nMonica: (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.\nRachel: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.\nMonica: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.\nRachel: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.\nJoey: Say that to him and you're golden.

I make your decisions and I say, \"I'm not fired!\" Ha!\nRachel: Well\u2026 (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)\nMonica: Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!\nJoey: (Poking his head out.)

It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.\nRoss: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.\nRachel: I'm gonna do it.\nMonica: All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.
