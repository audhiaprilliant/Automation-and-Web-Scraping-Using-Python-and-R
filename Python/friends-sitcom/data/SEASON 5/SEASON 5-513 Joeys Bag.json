Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.\nRoss: (walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.\nJoey: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)\nRoss: Sorry.\nChandler: (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)\nRoss: (glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.\nJoey: Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.\nChandler: And you're gonna make them all disappear.\nJoey: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.\n(Chandler picks up a basket from the table and puts it on his head.)\nChandler: Done.\nRachel: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.\nJoey: Great! Thanks, Rach!\nRachel: Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!\nJoey: All right.\n(Both of them remove their hats as Phoebe enters.)\nRoss: Hey Pheebs, how's it going?\nChandler: Hey.\nPhoebe: Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.\n(All at once.)\nRachel: What?\nRoss: Is everything okay?\nJoey: Are you all right?\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.\nJoey: Pheebs! Sorry!\nPhoebe: It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.\nRachel: Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?\nPhoebe: Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!\nMonica: (entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.\nRoss: Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.\nMonica: Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.\nPhoebe: It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.\nMonica: (to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?\nPhoebe: Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.\nJoey: Pheebs, I'm so sorry.\nPhoebe: It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; \"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter.\" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.\n"

Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)\nJoey: Really? A purse?\nRachel: It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.\nJoey: It looks like a women's purse.\nRachel: No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.\nJoey: See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.\nRachel: Exactly! Unisex!\nJoey: Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.\nRachel: No! No Joey!

Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.\nPhoebe: That's a defense?\nFrank Sr.: Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards.
