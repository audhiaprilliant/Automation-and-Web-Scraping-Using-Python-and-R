Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!\n[Cut to Joey hanging up the phone in Vegas. He's wearing a Roman gladiator's uniform and goes over to join a family to pose for a picture. You see, he's apparently taken a job at Caesar's Palace.]\nJoey: (to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.\nThe Husband: Okay!\nJoey: Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me now.\nEnding Credits\n"
