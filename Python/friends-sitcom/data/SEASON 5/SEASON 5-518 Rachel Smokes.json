This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!

There's a dad in the commercial?\nRoss: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.\nJoey: Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad.
