I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.\nMonica: That's very nice.\nChandler: That's sweet, Joey.\nJoey: Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up.

It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.\nChandler: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!\nFat Monica: I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.\nBig Nosed Rachel: Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!\nRoss: Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.\nFat Monica: Call them mom and dad you loser!\nRoss: (in a high pitched voice) Monica!\n[Time lapse, dinner has finished and Chandler is sitting on the couch eating some pie.

You should be a chef.\nFat Monica: Okay!\n(He gets up and walks away as Rachel come running over all excited.)\nBig Nosed Rachel: Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!\nFat Monica: Oh that's so great!\nBig Nosed Rachel: I know!\nFat Monica: Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.\nBig Nosed Rachel: Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.\nFat Monica: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!\nBig Nosed Rachel: I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!\n[Cut to the kitchen, Ross and Chandler are doing the dishes.]\nRoss: So I\u2019m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.\nChandler: Emotional Knapsack?\nRoss: Yeah.\nChandler: Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don\u2019t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.\nRoss: Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I\u2019m gonna be out with her all night.\nChandler: Dude, don't do that too me!\n(Monica enters behind them.)\nRoss: All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.\n(Monica suddenly gets very happy.)\nChandler: No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.\nRoss: Hey!\n(Upon hearing this, Monica starts to break down and storms out. Only to be stopped by her parents.)\nMrs. Geller: (holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies?

I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!\nRachel: Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him!

Just act like everything around you turns you on.\nMonica: What do you mean?\nRachel: Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!

Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.\nMonica: (excited) I can do that!\nRachel: Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)\nChandler: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.\nMonica: Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body.
