Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!

(They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?\n(Ross spots Chandler and starts chasing him around the kitchen table. Chandler runs and hides behind Monica.)\nRoss: What the hell are doing?!!\nRachel: (running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!\nChandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.\nJoey: (panicking) Dude! He's right there!\nRoss: (To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!\nChandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.\nMonica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.\n(There's a brief pause.)\nRoss: (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!\nRachel: Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.\n(There's another pause as Ross gets angry again.)\nRoss: What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!\nRachel: Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.\n(Pause.)\nRoss: (happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)\nJoey: Okay, all right, whew!

Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.\nRoss: It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!\nRachel: Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.\nRoss: Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run.

I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.\nRachel: Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.\nChandler: Wh-wh-why?!\nRachel: Well, because she loves you and because you love her.\nChandler: Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!\nRachel: Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.\nChandler: I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I\u2019m right. I'm right. Am I right?\nRachel: No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.\nChandler: Okay.
