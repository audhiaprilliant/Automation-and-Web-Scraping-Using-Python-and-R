All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)\nRachel: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.\nRachel: No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.\nPhoebe: Naked alone time.\nRachel: No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn\u2019t mean I wanna walk around naked.
