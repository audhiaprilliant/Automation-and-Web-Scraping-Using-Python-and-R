They're your underwear.\nJoey: (reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.\n(Follows Joey into their apartment and shrugs on his way out.)\n[Cut to the guy's apartment.]\nJoey: That's it!

What are you, 8?\nMonica: (entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!\nJoey: Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)\nMonica: (inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.\nJoey: Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't\u2026\nChandler: (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.\nJoey: Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!\nChandler: Well, yeah actually.\nMonica: We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.\nChandler: I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.\nMonica: We are! Help us!\nChandler: Help!\nJoey: All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.\nMonica: Joey!\nJoey: Didn't think so.\nOpening Credits\n"

Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!\nRachel: Okay.\nPhoebe: Yeah!

Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!\nMonica: Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)\nRoss: (quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.\n(Shows the note to Chandler who reads it aloud.)\nChandler: (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?\nJoey: I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.\nPhoebe: Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.\nRoss: Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, \"Keep your mitts off my grub?\"\nChandler: Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?\nPhoebe: Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
