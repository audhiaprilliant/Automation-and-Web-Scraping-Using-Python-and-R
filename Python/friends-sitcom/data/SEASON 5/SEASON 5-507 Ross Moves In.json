Didn't you sign a lease?\nRoss: Who needs a lease when it's family!\nJoey: Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!\nChandler: Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man!

Okay, this may take a while to explain, so center this on you screen and place your hands about a foot apart with your fingers together and pointing straight up. Now take you fingers and point them at the other hand and making a 90-degree angle with each of your hands and the first knuckle counting up from the wrist. Now take your right hand, no your other right (that was for the dyslexics), and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver.

Come on!\n(They go into his bedroom.)\nJoey: All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?

What if that had been porn?\nChandler: (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross!
