That would be sooo much fun!\nPhoebe: Oh, can I play too? I\u2019ve never played football, like ever.\nJoey: Great, you can cover Chandler.\nChandler: No, no, no, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t really wanna play.\nJoey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.\nChandler: That\u2019s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have goals!\nJoey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it\u2019ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don\u2019t play, everyone will be mad at you \u2018cause the teams won\u2019t be even. Come on.\nChandler: Yeah, all right, I\u2019ll play.\nPhoebe: Yay!!\nRachel: Let\u2019s do it! Ross?\nRoss: What?\nRachel: Do you wanna play football?\nRoss: Um, Monica and I aren\u2019t supposed to play football.\nJoey: Says who? Your mom?\nMonica and Ross: Yeah.\nMonica: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the \u2018Geller Bowl.\u2019\nChandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.\nMonica: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind\u2019ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross\u2019s nose.\nRoss: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.\nMonica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.\nRoss: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn\u2019t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.\nMonica: (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.\nRoss: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn\u2019t get the Geller Cup?\nRachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?\nRoss: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, \u2018nobody won that game, \u2018 and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.\nChandler: And was the curse lifted?\nRoss: Anyway. That\u2019s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.\nMonica: Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it\u2019s been twelve years.\nRoss: Can I see you for a second?\n(they walk over to the sink and discuss it for a moment)\nMonica: (shouting) Once!!\nRoss: All right, we\u2019re gonna play.\nChandler: But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won\u2019t let me cross the street.\n"

Why don\u2019t you stick around. You can sit right there.\n(she goes and sits down)\nChandler: Well, that went well.\nJoey: I think so.\nChandler: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.\nJoey: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.\nChandler: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.\nJoey: Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I\u2019ll let you have her.\nChandler: Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t have a shot?\nJoey: Well I don\u2019t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don\u2019t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You\u2019re better with numbers and stuff.\nChandler: Math!! You\u2019re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we\u2019ll see who gets her.\n[cut to later, in Ross\u2019s huddle.]\nRoss: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..\nRachel: Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it\u2019s like all I\u2019m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.\nRoss: Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?\nRachel: Can I see that for second.\nRoss: Yeah.\n(Rachel takes the ball from his hands and bounces it off of Ross\u2019s forehead and Chandler catches the rebound.)\nRoss: Okay. Hut! Hike!\n(Chandler runs around behind Ross, who pitches him the ball. Chandler runs upfield, and Joey knocks the ball out of his hands.)\nJoey: Fumble!\n(Joey starts to return the fumble and Chandler grabs Joey\u2019s shirt and rips it off of his back.)\nJoey: What the hell\u2019s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.\nChandler: Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.\nJoey: All right, that\u2019s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.\nChandler: Hey! Well, I\u2019ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that\u2019s mean!\nMonica: All right, come on guys, let\u2019s go! Tie score, and we\u2019re runnin\u2019 out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)\nPhoebe: Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!\nJoey: Pheebs, run!\nMonica: Run, Phoebe, run!\n(Phoebe runs and scores a touchdown.)\nPhoebe: Touchdown!! Touchdown!!\nRoss: Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn\u2019t count.\nMonica: After the snap!\nRoss: Before the snap!\nJoey: After!!\nChandler: Before!!\nRachel: Now, does it really matter?\nAll: Yes!!\nPhoebe: Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?\nRoss: Oh Pheebs, that\u2019s great. It doesn\u2019t count.\nMonica: Does so count!\nRoss: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\nMonica: Y'know what, that\u2019s fine, maybe you haven\u2019t grown up, but I have.\nRoss: Oh-ho, okay.\nMonica: Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)\nRoss: Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.\nPhoebe: Woo-yay!!\nMonica: No! Listen, I\u2019m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can\u2019t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let\u2019s just call this, tie score and it\u2019s halftime.\nRoss: Okay, first of all, I don\u2019t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!\nMonica: Y'know what? I\u2019ll think you\u2019ll play.\nRoss: Oh really! Why is that?\n[cut to Monica and Rachel\u2019s.]\nMonica: Because the winner gets this!\nRoss: The Geller Cup.\nChandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?\nAll: Yeah.\nChandler: Okay, good.\nCommercial Break\n"

Phoebe starts screaming and runs up to him and tries to tackle him. But all she ends up doing is running around his waist and screaming.]\n[Sequence 4: Ross hikes the ball to Chandler, and the camera pans down to show Rachel standing deep in the end zone, playing with her gum. Something hits her on the head and she looks up to see where it came from.]\n[Sequence 5: Monica hands the ball off to Phoebe, who runs up field and delivers a fore-arm shiver to Chandler, knocking him over and scores the touchdown, and she yells...]\nPhoebe: I love this game!!\n[cut to Ross who walks up to Rachel who is eating a baked pretzel.]\nRoss: Hey, where\u2019d you get that?\nRachel: I went really long.\nMonica: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!\nRoss: It\u2019s no surprise that your winning, \u2018cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.\nMonica: You\u2019re so pathetic! Why can\u2019t you just accept it, we\u2019re winning because I\u2019m better than you.\n(Ross makes a \u2018Yeah. Right.\u2019 sound.)\nMonica: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I\u2019ll prove it to you, okay. I\u2019ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I\u2019ll still win the game.\nRoss: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that\u2019s ridiculous Monica, because I\u2019m only down by three touchdowns.\nMonica: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.\nRoss: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you\u2019re with me.\nRachel: I can not believe your trading me!!\nMonica: Come on Rach, come on. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s it like to be on a winning team for a change.\nRachel: Are you gonna let me play?\nMonica: All right then.\n[cut to the guys\u2019 team.]\nMargha: (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?\nChandler: No-no-no-no, the game\u2019s not over, we\u2019re just switching teams.\nJoey: Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it\u2019s better if we\u2019re on the same team.\nRoss: Right. Okay, let\u2019s play. Let\u2019s go.\nChandler: No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?\nJoey: Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.\nChandler: And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?\nJoey: Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.\nMargha: Oh, my.\nRoss: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let\u2019s play some ball, guys.\nJoey: Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I\u2019m not playing with this guy, now.\nChandler: Fine with me.\nRoss: Okay, y'know what, let\u2019s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?\nChandler and Joey: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?\nMargha: Which do I like?\nRoss: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...\nMargha: Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.\nChandler: Yes!!\nJoey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn\u2019t understand the question.\nChandler: Well, you don\u2019t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.\nMargha: I\u2019m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.\nChandler: You hear that! That is her chose, mister I\u2019ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)\nMargha: I\u2019m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.\nChandler: Wh-what?\nMargha: I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.\nJoey: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.\nChandler: Y'know what, it doesn\u2019t matter, \u2018cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!\nRoss: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.\nChandler: We\u2019re not gonna lose to girls.\nRoss: Hey! It\u2019s 42-21!\nJoey: This sucks, I was just up by that much!\nMonica: Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.\n[cut to the girls huddle.]\nMonica: We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you\u2019re making out...\nPhoebe: Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!\nMonica: Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let\u2019s kill \u2018um!\nRachel: Yeah!!! Kill \u2018um!!!\nPhoebe: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?\n(Another football sequence follows)\n[Sequence 1: Chandler is running past Phoebe with the ball, Phoebe flashes him, he stops and stares dumbfounded at her. Phoebe then runs up and takes the ball away.]\n[Sequence 2: Phoebe throws the ball, and it\u2019s intercepted by Joey, who starts to run up field. Rachel jumps on his back in order to try and tackle him, but she doesn\u2019t slow him down. Monica and Phoebe then both grab her legs in order to stop Joey, who still manages to fight through the tackle and score the touchdown.]\n[Sequence 3: Chandler is running with the ball, Phoebe flashes him again, but Chandler covers his eyes, and keeps running. He then runs into a tree at the end of the field.]\n[cut to the girls huddle]\nMonica: All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we\u2019re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.\nRachel: No! Come on! Don\u2019t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.\nMonica: Honey, there\u2019s a reason.\nRachel: God, I\u2019m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.\nPhoebe: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.\nMonica: All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I\u2019ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.\nRachel: Thank you! Break!\nMonica: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!\n(Phoebe snaps the ball to Monica, who pitches back to Rachel.)\nThe Guys: One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!\n(They all rush toward Rachel, who panics and runs away. She runs out of the park and up along the fence, she then comes back into the park and runs past Monica, as she gets to Monica, she throws the ball at Monica, and it hits her in the eye.)\nRachel: I\u2019m so sorry! Are you okay?\nMonica: No! I\u2019m not okay!\nRachel: I\u2019m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\nJoey: (looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!\nChandler: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!\nMonica: Come on! Come on! Hurry! We\u2019re running out of time! Huddle up!\nPhoebe: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.\nMonica: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.\nRachel: (on the verge of tears) Okay.\nMonica: Break!\n(In slow motion, Phoebe snaps the ball, Rachel goes long. Joey and Chandler and all over Phoebe, leaving Rachel wide open. Ross starts to rush Monica, who sees Phoebe is double covered, in desperation she throws to Rachel. We see flying through the air, and then Rachel running underneath it, then the ball, then Rachel again, then the ball, then Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey staring at it in shock. Then with the grace of Jerry Rice (no offense to Jerry Rice), Rachel catches the ball, and she stops and spikes the ball. Both Phoebe and Monica erupt in celebration.)\nRachel: (in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!\nChandler: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you\u2019re five feet short, so we win!\nPhoebe: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn\u2019t the play still going.\n(they all start to dive for the ball and Monica and Ross grab it at the same time.)\nRoss: Let go! Let go!\nMonica: Let go! I\u2019m a tiny little woman!!\nChandler: Guys! Guys! Come on! It\u2019s Thanksgiving, it\u2019s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!\nMonica: Ow!!\nClosing Credits\n"
