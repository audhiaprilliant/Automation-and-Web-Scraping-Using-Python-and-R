What is she gonna say?\u2019 when I tell her what I did.\nChandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?\nRoss: What?! Look, we\u2019re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?\nJoey: Look, Ross look, I\u2019m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that\u2019s gonna get you in trouble.\nChandler: He\u2019s right. Nobody\u2019s gonna benefit, and you\u2019re just gonna hurt her.\nJoey: Yeah, and there won\u2019t be a relationship left to rebuild.\nRoss: Yeah, but don\u2019t you think....\nChandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing\u2019s right. And that\u2019s what deathbeds are for.\nRoss: Yeah, okay.

(spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?\nRoss: What trail?\nJoey: (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!\nRoss: Oh, I-I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any trail.\nChandler: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac.

Let\u2019s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?\nRoss: (pause) Yes I would.\nRachel: You\u2019d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?\nRoss: (less sure) Yes.\nRachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....\nRoss: (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you.

I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.\nPhoebe: We could eat the wax! It\u2019s organic.\nChandler: Oh great, food with hair on it.\nPhoebe: No, not the used wax.\nChandler: Because that would be crazy?\n[Cut to Living Room]\nRoss: Hey, can I, can I get in on that?

Yes, I\u2019d like to order a large pizza.\nRoss: No anchovies.\nRachel: With ah, extra anchovies.\nRoss: That\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just pick \u2018em off.\nRachel: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?\n[Cut to later, they are finishing up the pizza, there\u2019s one piece left.]\nRoss: You can have the last piece, if you want.\nRachel: Well, I should think so.

You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.\nPhoebe: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.\n[Cut to Living Room]\nRoss: Y'know what, y'know what, I\u2019m-I\u2019m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You\u2019re the one that bailed on us. You\u2019re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!\nRachel: That\u2019s....\nRoss: That\u2019s what?!\nRachel: That is neither here nor there.\nRoss: Okay, well here we are. Now we\u2019re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I\u2019m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can\u2019t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can\u2019t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.\n(He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just before he kisses her on the lips....)\nRachel: No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don\u2019t! You can\u2019t just kiss me and think you\u2019re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn\u2019t work that way. It doesn\u2019t just make it better. Okay?\nRoss: Okay, okay, okay.\nRachel: (softly) I think you should go.\nRoss: What?\nRachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.\nRoss: (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn\u2019t work past it together...\nRachel: Yeah, what the hell did I know!\nRoss: Look, look, there\u2019s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can\u2019t imagine, I can\u2019t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....\nRachel: (crying) No. I can\u2019t, you\u2019re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can\u2019t stop picturing with her, I can\u2019t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn\u2019t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It\u2019s just changed, everything. Forever.\n[We see the rest of them are now crying.]\nRoss: (crying) Yeah, but this can\u2019t be it, I mean.\n(Pause)\nRachel: Then how come it is?\nClosing Credits\n"
