(Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)\nRachel: Come on, it\u2019s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn\u2019t smoked since.\nRoss: Pffhah.\nRachel: (to Ross) What\u2019s your problem?\nRoss: Nothing, it\u2019s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.\nRachel: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.\nRoss: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.\nRachel: Oh right, \u2018cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.\nPhoebe: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.\nChandler: Or what my Father called Thursday night.\nOpening Credits\n"

Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less\u2026\nPhoebe: None the less.\nAlice: None the less. Umm, you\u2019re too young to, to really know what you want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)\nPhoebe: That\u2019s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it\u2019s a good bye kiss, that\u2019s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I\u2019m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).\nClosing Credits\n"
