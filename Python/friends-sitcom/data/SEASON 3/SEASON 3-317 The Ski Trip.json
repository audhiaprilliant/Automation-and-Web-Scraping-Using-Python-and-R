He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you\u2019re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.\nChandler: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn\u2019t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.\nPhoebe: Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up.
