But I mean that\u2019s a classic, what\u2019s so great about The Shining?\nJoey: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it\u2019s way better than that classic of yours.\nRachel: Okay. Ah, well we\u2019ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn\u2019t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.\nJoey: All right, you got it.\nRachel: All right.\nJoey: Okay.\nRachel: Okay.\nJoey: Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.\nRachel: Yeah.\nJoey: How little are they?
