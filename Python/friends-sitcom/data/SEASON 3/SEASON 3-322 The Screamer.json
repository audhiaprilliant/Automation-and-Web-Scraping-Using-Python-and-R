One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you\u2019ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so\u2026 I\u2019m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I\u2019m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you\u2019ll be long gone. But I won\u2019t have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I\u2019m gonna want to meet her.\n(The ladder retracts, taking Joey up into the spaceship for his voyage to Blargon 7, and Kate waves good bye.)\nLauren: So long, Vic! (waving good bye as the ladder retracts)\nClosing Credits\n"
