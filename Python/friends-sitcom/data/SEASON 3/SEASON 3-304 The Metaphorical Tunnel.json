It's on again!\nJoey: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.\nAll: Shhhh!\nHost: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.\nJoey: (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!\nMike: And there is Kevin.\nJoey: Can we please turn this off?\nRachel: Noo way, Kevin.\nMike: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.\nRoss: (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?\nChandler: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!\nMike: Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (to Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.\nJoey: (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.\n(They all start laughing at him)\nOpening Credits\n"

What's up?\nJoey: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!\nChandler: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.\nPhoebe: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was me!\nJoey: How is it you?\nPhoebe: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him her hand)\nJoey: Yep, that's my audition.\nMonica: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.\nPhoebe: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.\nJanice: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.\nJoey: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.\nPhoebe: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.\nJoey: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.\nPhoebe: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing).\nJoey: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?\nPhoebe: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'\nJoey: Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)\nPhoebe: (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'\nChandler: Is anybody else scared?\nPhoebe: (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)\nChandler: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad!

Why, why, why does he have it, again?\nSusan: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.\nCarol: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?\nRoss: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.\n(cut to later in the day)\nRoss: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?

Answer the phone.\nJoey: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.\nChandler: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.\nRachel: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?\nChandler: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.\nRoss: And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?\nChandler: Noo.\nRoss: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.\nChandler: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'\nRachel: Men are unbelievable.\nMonica: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?\nChandler: I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.\nMonica: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.\nJoey: Hey, you know about that?!\nChandler: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!\n(Joey looks quizzically at Ross)\nRoss: (to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.\nChandler: Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?\nJoey: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.\nRachel: Amazingly, that makes sense.\nChandler: You think?\nJoey: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!\nChandler: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.\n"
