Hey, what are you doing Friday?\nRoss: Why?\nChandler: I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.\nRoss: Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.\nChandler: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?\nRoss: Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)\nPhoebe: (entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!\nChandler: (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.\nRachel: (running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.\nPhoebe: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.\nRachel: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.\nRoss: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?\nRachel: Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.\nRoss: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?\nRachel: Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?\nPhoebe: Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.\nRachel: Oh.\nChandler: (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?\nRoss: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?\nChandler: Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.\nPhoebe: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich\ufffd. Why don't you get a magician?!\nChandler: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.\nOpening Credits\n"
