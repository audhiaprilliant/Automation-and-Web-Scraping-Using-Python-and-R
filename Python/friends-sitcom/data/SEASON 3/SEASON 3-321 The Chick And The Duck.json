And I\u2019m okay with that.\nMonica: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t take this job.\nPete: What?\nMonica: And well, we probably shouldn\u2019t see each other anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\nPete: Okay, yeah. I mean... If that\u2019s, if that\u2019s really what you want, okay.\nMonica: Okay, bye.\n(She kisses him on the cheek, and he kisses her back on the mouth.)\nPete: I\u2019m sorry things didn\u2019t work out...\nMonica: All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)\n"
