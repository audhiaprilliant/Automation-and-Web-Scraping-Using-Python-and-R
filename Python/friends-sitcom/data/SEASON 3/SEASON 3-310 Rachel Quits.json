Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.\nPhoebe: Really?\n(Phoebe turns and looks at Monica, while Joey frantically motions to Chandler to help him out.)\nChandler: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it\u2019s the only chance to see New York.\n[cut to Gunther retraining Rachel.]\nGunther: ...and after you\u2019ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....\nRachel: Gunther, Gunther, please, I\u2019ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.

My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he\u2019d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.\nRoss: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.\nSarah: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he\u2019s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.\nRoss: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?\nSarah: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.\nRoss: Yeah.\nSarah: So far, I\u2019ve sold seventy-five.\nRoss: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?\nSarah: Five dollars a box.\nRoss: (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?\nSarah: A ten speed bike. But, I\u2019d rather have something my Dad couldn\u2019t sell.\nRoss: Well, that makes sense.\nSarah: Could you do me one favor, if it\u2019s not too much trouble?\nRoss: Yeah, Sarah, anything.\nSarah: Could you pull open the curtains for me?
