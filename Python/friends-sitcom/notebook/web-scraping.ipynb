Now I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\\nMonica: And they weren\\'t looking at you before?!\\nChandler: Finally, I figure I\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\\n[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]\\nRoss: (mortified) Hi.\\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\\nChandler: Cookie?\\nMonica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.\\nJoey: Ohh.\\nMonica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.\\nRoss: Thanks.\\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)\\nRoss: No, no don\\'t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\\nPhoebe: Fine!

Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn\\'t know, how should I know?\\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?\\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I\\'ll never have grandchildren, I\\'ll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\\nRoss: Sorry.\\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You\\'re feeling a lot of pain right now. You\\'re angry. You\\'re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\\n(Ross gestures his consent.)\\nJoey: Strip joint! C\\'mon, you\\'re single! Have some hormones!\\nRoss: I don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\\n(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)\\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)\\nMonica: Rachel?!\\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\\nMonica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\\nRachel: Hi, sure!\\nRoss: Hi.\\n(They go to hug but Ross\\'s umbrella opens.  He sits back down defeated again.  A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)\\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\\nMonica: Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.\\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue... \\n'}"

He sits back down defeated again.  A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)\\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\\nMonica: Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.\\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an issue... \\n'},\n",
