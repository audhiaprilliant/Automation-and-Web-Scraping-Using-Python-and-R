# KUHP Scrapper
## What is KUHP
KUHP stands for Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana or well-known as the The  Indonesian  Penal  Code in English. It is believed to be about 72 years old as per the enactment of Law No. 1/1946 on the regulation of criminal law. However, if based on Wetbook van Strafrecht enacted by the Dutch Parliament on March 3, 18811, Indonesia's current Penal Code is approximately 137 years old. After such a long period of time, it canâ€™t be denied that the substance of some of the thoughts in the provisions contained in the Penal Code are no longer contextual with the condition of Indonesian society today.
